**Pre-Analysis Plan**

Using the NCDS focusing on the third and fourth waves of the birth cohort study (16 and 23 years old) I am attempting to understand what the patterns of social inequality are within youth transitions. 

The promotion of Pre-analysis plans has predominately seen success amongst those studies engaged in primary data analysis. Secondary data anlysis demands the utilisation of pre-analysis plans. 
The huge variety and choice of varibles that these datasets- especially the NCDS offers provides a temptation that can very easily lead down the p-hacking rabbit hole. 
Whilst HARKing (Hypothesing after results are known; (Kerr 1998) is not something that will impact my analysis (considering this will be the first time I will be engaging with this dataset) nevertheless, continued use of this dataset is a given and so another beneift of the pre-analysis plan comes to light. 
Statistical hypothesis tests are only valid when the hypotheses are drawn up a priori. 
It is my hope that engaging with pre-analysis plans provides adequete openess within this PhD project and to combat the 'reliability' crisis that has plagued the social sciences for some time now.
