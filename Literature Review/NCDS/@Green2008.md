### Abstract

```
When describing the determinants of economic or social outcomes, economists often have a very simplified view of skill. Failure to take into account the fact that skill is intrinsically a multidimensional object may misguide both research and the design of social policy.
```

### Notes

“We find that an overall measure of non-cognitive skill is important for a host of outcomes” (Green, 2008, p. 3)
