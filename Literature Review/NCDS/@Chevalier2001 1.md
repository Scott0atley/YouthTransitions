### Abstract

```
Britain is characterised by a low rate of post compulsory schooling compared to other European countries. To reduce this disparity, the British government has been testing an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) where 16 to 19-year olds are given financial support to attend schooling when the family income falls below a threshold. This paper attempts at first separating family and income effects and second estimating the impact of a financial transfer on educational attainment.

### Notes

“Children from poorer backgrounds are generally observed to have lower educational outcomes than other youth.” (Chevalier and Lanot, 2001, p. 3)

“s in previous studies, we find that pupils from poorer families are less likely to invest in education. However, a financial transfer would not lead to a significant increase in schooling investment, which supports the view that the family characteristic effects dominate the financial constraint effects.” (Chevalier and Lanot, 2001, p. 3)
