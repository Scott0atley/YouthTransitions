### Notes

“6-year-olds with part-time jobs, modal earnings were in the range £1–£2 per week (the data are in banded form), and some 8 per cent of those working earned £6 per week or mo” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 86)

“Half of the 16year-olds in the National Child Development Study in 1974 had a part-time job during term-time; on average, those working worked for between six and nine hours per week.” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 100)
