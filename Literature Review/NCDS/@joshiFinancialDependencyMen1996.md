### Abstract

```
This paper examines some evidence from the 1958 NCDS birth cohort about what is actually happening to financial imbalance within British couples. The increased proportion of women in the labourforce is not uniformly matched by an equivalent increase in the share of women's earnings in the householdbudget.
```

### Notes

“The increased proportion of women in the labourforce is not uniformly matched by an equivalent increase in the share of women's earnings in the householdbudget. While women approach half of the labourforce, few women in couples of this, or other,generations bring home as much as half the total cash” (Joshi and Davies, 1996, p. 35)
