### Abstract

```
The transition from school to work is a crucial phase in the life course. It is when a young person becomes ready to assume adult responsibilities, and indicates a shift from dependent childhood to independent adulthood. It has been argued that in response to changes in labour market opportunities and increasing unemployment, the patterns of youth transitions have changed over the last two decades, becoming more protracted and complex (Bynner et al. 1999; Furlong & Cartmel, 1997a,b; Dench & Richardson, 1987; Roberts & Parsell, 1992). While twenty years ago young people were able to formulate relatively clear ideas about their likely destination in the labour market, today they have to face more uncertainties about the possible outcomes (Lightfoot, 1997). The aim of this study is to assess the extent and the direction of these changes in the transition from school to work by comparing two birth cohorts born twelve years apart. The study draws on life history data from two British cohorts: the 1958 National Child Development Study, and the 1970 British Cohort Study.

### Notes
“Our results show that despite major transformations in the labour market situation between 1970 and 1990, there is considerable continuity in the pathways by which young people enter it. However, for the later born cohort the entry into the labour market is characterised by more fluid transition patterns. Growing unemployment and shrinking labour force participation are combined with increasing time spent in education. This supports the view that polarisation has been occurring in the pattern of youth transitions: increased opportunities are offered to some, while problems of marginalisation and social exclusion are the experience” (Schoon et al., 2001, p. 4)

“in comparison to the NCDS cohort, where training led to full-time employment, the experience of training in the later born cohort is associated with the repeated experience of unemployment.” (Schoon et al., 2001, p. 8)
