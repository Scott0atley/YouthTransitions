### Abstract

```
We explore the determinants of one aspect of religious behavior and church attendance, using individual level data from the British National Child Development Study (NCDS), explicitly focusing on the relationship between education and church attendance. In contrast to the existing literature, our data allow an exploration of the dynamic dimension to religious activity since the NCDS provides information on church attendance at three stages of an individual’s life cycle. The results support a positive association between education and church attendance. Additionally, current participation in religious activities is positively associated with past religious behavior.
