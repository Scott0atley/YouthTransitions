### Abstract

```
This paper has two aims. The first is to examine the comparability of the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study, known as the National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study (LS), in terms of the information they provide about the employment profile of their respective samples. The second aim is to describe changes in occupational segregation in England and Wales in the decade between 1991 and 2000/2001. By using the longitudinal data contained in both the NCDS and the LS it is possible to examine not only the aggregate changes in occupational segregation, but also individual transitions between different types of occupations characterised according to the percentage of women working within the occupation.

### Notes

“women and men born in the late 1950s were almost equally segregated from one another at the beginning of the 1990s when they were in their early thirties as they 17 However, we need to be cautious and not overstretch the differences found in this point, given the very different attention that each study pays to the collection of information on qualifications - and the different modes of data collection used by the NCDS and the Census. 18 In the LS the evidence about people lost to follow up shows contrasting patterns for men and women. A study of the percentage of traced LS members found in 1991 but not accounted for in 2001, by social class in 1991 and sex, concluded that, for men, linkage failure is higher at the bottom of the social classification (with 16.6 per cent of males in unskilled occupations in 1991 not found in 2001), whereas for women linkage failure is at its highest among professional women, at 11.6 per cent (Blackwell et al. 2003, p30)” (Guinea-Martin and Elliott, 2008, p. 34)

“35 were a decade later, when they were in their early forties. However, there was a slight decrease in segregation largely due to the feminisation of certain occupations” (Guinea-Martin and Elliott, 2008, p. 35)
