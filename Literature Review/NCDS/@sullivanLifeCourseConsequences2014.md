### Abstract

```
This chapter reports on a study examining whether attending single-sex rather than coeducational secondary schools made a difference to the lives of a cohort of men and women born in Britain in 1958. The project aimed to assess the impact of single-sex secondary schooling, not just on short term and narrowly academic outcomes, but also on longer term social, psychological and economic outcomes. In a generally gendered environment for adults, did it make any difference to have been to a gender segregated school, and in what way? This chapter provides an overview of our findings, and a discussion of the implications for policy and for future research.

### Notes

“We found that single-sex schooling had a positive impact on academic outcomes at age 16 for girls, and no impact at all for boys” (Sullivan and Joshi, 2014, p. 26)
