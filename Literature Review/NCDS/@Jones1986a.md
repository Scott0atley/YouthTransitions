### Abstract

```
The research is an empirical study of the transitions from adolescence to adulthood in Britain. Transitions in work, family formation and housing are all examined in the context of the social class and mobility of young people who are in the process of achieving. social identity in their own right. Differentiation of the experience of youth occurs according to gender, class of origin, educational level, whether an individual is socially mobile, and the means of mobility. A typology of "youth class" is developed as a conceptual framework for understanding stratification in youth and as an analytic tool for measuring different life experiences of the young.

### Notes

“The study finds that class reproduction is a complicated process, particularly for the middle class. Inter-generaticnal mobility is often achieved only through a complicated process of intragenerational mobility in the young generation. Middle class families give active help during this process. Upward mobility of the working class is more of an individual achievement.” (Jones, 1986, p. 2)
