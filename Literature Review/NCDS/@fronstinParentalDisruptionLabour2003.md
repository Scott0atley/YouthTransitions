### Abstract

```
This paper uses data from the age 33 wave of the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS) to analyze the e¨ects of a parental disruption (divorce or death of a father) on the labour market performance of children when they reach adulthood. The NCDS is a longitudinal study of all children born during the ®rst week of March 1958 in England, Scotland, and Wales. Controlling for a rich set of pre-disruption characteristics, the results indicate that a parental disruption leads to moderately less employment among males and considerably lower wage rates among females at age 33. If pre-disruption characteristics are not controlled for, larger e¨ects are estimated for both males and females. Parental disruption also seems to cause substantial reductions in educational attainment for both males and females.
