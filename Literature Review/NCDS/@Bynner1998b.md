### Abstract

```
B ritain's longitudinal birth cohort studies are a unique research resource, which no other country can match. They began as studies of the conditions surrounding conception and birth and, in certain respects, developed as longitudinal studies largely fortuitously. In this review, I want to say a word about their history before moving on to the prospects for their future and how these bear particularly on research on children.1 The distinguishing feature of the British birth cohort studies is that they are national, that is they fully represent directly in the case of the National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70) and indirectly after weighting in the case of the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the whole population of births in the year in which they began.
