### Abstract

```
This introductory chapter sets out to provide some context, and answer the following questions. To what extent and why are poor children disadvantaged in education? What are the aspects of home background related to poverty that matter? Are there important intersections with other social characteristics such as ethnic group and gender? What is the role of geography, including differences between the four UK countries? How do trajectories of disadvantage emerge across the school life course?

### Notes

“he evidence indicates that children whose parents are more involved in their education have better educational outcomes. Nevertheless, reviews of the literature find that there is little evidence that interventions based on increasing parental involvement are effective” (Connelly et al., 2014, p. 61)

“re is evidence that the attitudes and aspirations of parents and children are associated with educational attainment. However there is no evidence that attitudes and aspirations cause improved attainment.” (Connelly et al., 2014, p. 61)

“he social mobility chances of individual children may well be best increased via educational attainment. However, the overall level of poverty in society is driven by structural inequalities in our economy and society, which clearly cannot be addressed simply by reforming schools.” (Connelly et al., 2014, p. 62)

“hile poverty matters, parents’ education is an even more powerful predictor of children’s educational outcomes.” (Connelly et al., 2014, p. 62)

“cio-economic differences in educational attainment trump both race and gender, and should be given the highest priority.” (Connelly et al., 2014, p. 62)
