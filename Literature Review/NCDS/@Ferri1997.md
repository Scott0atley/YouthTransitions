### Abstract

```
The purpose of this short study was, firstly, to identify a group of NCDS cohort members who, as parents, had separated from a partner who was the other parent of their children, and to investigate the circumstances and aftermath of the relationship breakdown. The findings revealed that almost half of the mothers involved, but less than one in five of the fathers, reported that the separation in question was preceded by conflict involving physical violence. The great majority of children had remained with their mother following the break. Most of the fathers living away from their children were in contact with them, and supported them financially. Contact was rather less likely when violence had occurred in the parental relationship, and current relationships with ex-partners were less likely to be friendly. The second aim of the study the study was to identify parents in currently 'intact' families whose relationship with their partners appeared to be in difficulty. Considerably more mothers than fathers fell into this category on the basis of self-report. These 'unhappy' parents - especially mothers - were much more likely than their 'happy' counterparts to report disagreement with their partner on a range of domestic and personal issues. A straightforward comparison of these various groups on a number of measures of well-being showed that parents currently in unhappy relationships, especially mothers, were least likely to feel satisfied with, and in control, of their lives. As far as their children were concerned, those whose parents had separated (especially where violence had occurred), or were currently in unhappy relationships, were more likely than their peers in happy intact families to show signs of developmental difficulties .
