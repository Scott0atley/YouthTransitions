### Abstract

```
Since the 1970s in Britain, women’s hourly wages have increased, in real terms and relative to men’s wages. The observed increase may differ from trends in wage opportunities for the whole population though, since the proportion of women in work has simultaneously increased and, with it, the relative characteristics of the workforce have changed. We have analysed trends across three British generations, covering the period 1972-2004. We use detailed, longitudinal data from the birth cohort studies to impute potential wages for non-employed individuals. Our results suggest that observed wage trends understate the full increase in women’s wage opportunities over this period.
