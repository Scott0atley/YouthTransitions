### Abstract

```
Data from the National Child Development Study are used to examine the relationship between school attendance, at the ages of 7 and 15, and reading and mathematics test scores and school behaviour at the age of 16. A relationship between attendanceand attainmentis found, which is reduced but remains statisticallysignificant after allowance for related social factors. The relationship between 15-year attendance and attainment is reasonably consistent across categories of the social factors, e.g. for different social classes. The relationship between 7-year attendance and 16-year attainment and behaviour is not significant once allowance for attendance at 15 is made.
