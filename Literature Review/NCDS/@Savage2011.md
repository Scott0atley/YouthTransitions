### Abstract

```
There is a general view that social mobility in Britain declined in the second half of the twentieth century, that Britain is no longer a meritocratic country where a personâ€™s life chances are determined by effort and talent rather than by family background. Declining social mobility has been a concern for successive governments and the current coalition Government is no exception. It has made social mobility its top social policy priority, with the publication of a social mobility strategy expected in the coming weeks.
