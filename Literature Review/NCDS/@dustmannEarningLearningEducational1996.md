### Notes

“The 'traditional' view, in both educational and labour-market policy, of the transition from education to employment centres on the school-leaving decision” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 79)

“There is, however, substantial evidence to suggest that for more and more teenagers,the transition from school to employment does not centre around a single event, school leaving. For many, there is a period of overlap between education and labour-force participation, during which individuals work part-time whilst remaining within the full-time education system” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 80)

“Amongst those 16-year-oldswith part-time jobs, modal earnings were in the range El42per week (the data are in banded form), and some 8 per cent of those working earned &6per week or more.’” On average, hours worked were between six and nine per week.” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 86)

“One way of disentangling the relative effects of various individual and household characteristics is to estimate a reduced-form probit model of the probability of participatio” (Dustmann et al., 1996, p. 86)
