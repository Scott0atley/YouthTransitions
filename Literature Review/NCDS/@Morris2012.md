### Abstract

```
This document provides basic statistics and administrative information on the coding processes of the National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the British Cohort Study (BCS) and their questions referring to employment occupation. It is also a guide to the sections that are included in the data outputs for resubmission to the Institute of Education (IOE), and any information pertaining to the methodology, validations studies, previous use, coding of data, and relevant references. This document outlines the process taken by ALSPAC researchers in coding questionnaire responses to occupation through to social class classifications.

### Notes

“To create occupational code classifications the computerised questionnaire response text strings were converted into comma separated value files and processed using the CASCOT” (Morris, 2012, p. 7)

“software programme using automatic and semi-automatic processing to assign standard occupational classification 2000 codes” (Morris, 2012, p. 7)

“The automatic processing assigns occupational codes to every entry, assigning the most likely code regardless of score/level of accuracy. The semi-automatic process was run at a cut-off point of 45 (inclusive) leaving all coding suggestions with a low score (<46) to be manually assigned by the researcher” (Morris, 2012, p. 7)

“The reason for using a semi-automatic system is based upon the excessive time required for researchers to make accurate decisions going through the datasets line by line” (Morris, 2012, p. 7) THIS!!!
