### Abstract

```
IT is frequently argued that a cause of the UK's poor economic performance is her low level of skills relative to her competitors (Bean and Symons, 1990; Greenhalgh, 1990; and Crafts 1991). In the UK in 1988, the share of the labour force with intermediate examined vocational qualifications was 19%, as compared with 64% for Germany and 40% for France (Steedman, 1990; and Crafts, 1991). Of the OECD countries, the UK in 1986-7 had the second lowest enrolment rate in education and training for the 15-19 year age group—54.3%. Only Australia fared worse; the enrolment rate for France was 73.4%, for Germany 76.2%, for Japan 71.0%, and for the US 78.8% (OECD, 1989). Traditionally, apprenticeships in Britain have provided training for a sub-set of school leavers at the age of 16. However, the number of apprenticeships in British manufacturing has been declining in the past three decades, from 240,400 school leavers in 1964, dropping to 155,000 in 1979, and to 53,700 by 1990 (Employment Gazette, various issues).1
