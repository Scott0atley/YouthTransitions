### Abstract

```
At the time when the practice of grouping each year according to ability was first introduced into schools its advantages were seen purely in cognitive terms (Downey & Kelly, 1975; Davies, 1975). Since then the assumption that streaming will benefit children's attainment has been questioned (e.g. Barker Lunn, 1970; Ferri, 1971; Fogelman et al., 1978) but in addition consideration has been paid to the possibility of social and emotional disadvantages associated with streaming (e.g. Barker-Lunn, 1970; Douglas, 1973; Willig, 1963; Davies, 1975; Rudd, 1958; Lacey, 1970). In general these disadvantages are associated with the practice of selection and therefore are similar to those of concern to the advocates of comprehensivisation. Examples of the gain expected from eliminating selection are in the areas of enhanced self-respect, social integration, motivation, attitudes to school and occupational horizons of the pupils as well as flexibility in the school's organisation (Ford, 1969; Jackson, 1964; Ross et al., 1972).
