### Abstract

```
In order to assess the roles of schooling and educational qualifications in the emergence of adult social exclusion, a series of detailed regression models were explored separately for men and women for each of a wide range of indicators of adult disadvantage at both ages 23 and 33, including experience of unemployment, being in receipt of non-universal benefits, low income, low occupational class, living in social housing, and a high malaise score, as well as ever being a lone mother; a number of other measures were considered at age 23, such as experience of not being in education or employment for 16 to 23, early parenthood, or at age 33, such as lacking a telephone or cigarette smoking.
