### Abstract

```
Inglehart’s postulated value shift towards ‘post-materialism’ across the generations and social exclusion theorists’ such as Collins’ forecasts of a growing underclass predict two apparently contradictory outcomes in relation to belief in the ‘Protestant Work Ethic’ (PWE). In earlier cohorts commitment to employment was strongest in the least educated and among the unemployed. In more recent cohorts, the most educated and the least educated young people are likely to share in common a tendency to reject the PWE more than those in the middle educational range, producing a ‘U-shaped’ relationship. This paper uses data collected in two longitudinal birth cohort studies—the National Child Development Study (1958 birth cohort) at age 33 and the 1970 British Cohort Study (1970 birth cohort) at age 26 to investigate the possibility of such a value shift. Using a measure of ‘employment commitment’ derived from Furnham’s measure of PWE, multivariate analysis of the survey data supports the hypothesized U-shaped relationship between the PWE and quali cation level in the younger cohort, especially among young women. Young women in the more recent cohort also show overall stronger commitment to the PWE.
