### Abstract

```
A considerable amount of evidence now exists to show that at any given age there are differences in average attainment between children from different backgrounds. A number of studies have demonstrated that differences in social class and family size are associated with differences in children's test scores: it is also well known that children from homes with fewer basic amenities and higher levels of living density tend to have poorer attainments at school (Davie, Butler & Goldstein, 1972).

### Notes

“The ones found in this study to be the most effective in predicting educational failure were in fact educational criteria themselves.” (Hutchison et al., 1979, p. 81)
