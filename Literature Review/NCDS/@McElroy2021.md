### Abstract

```
The CLOSER British birth cohorts have collected a wealth of information on cognition over the life course of different generations. However, cross-study comparisons of cognitive ability are challenging as a multitude of different tests have been administered over the years (for a comprehensive guide see Moulton et al. (2020)). Such inconsistencies within and across studies represents a significant challenge for researchers who wish to pool and compare individual-level data from multiple studies or assessment waves.
