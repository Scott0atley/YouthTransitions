### Abstract

```
For nearly 20 years, equal treatment of men and women in the labour market has been enshrined in British law. This was due to the twin acts supporting this: the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. There were amendments in 1983 to allow equal pay to be claimed in comparable, rather than identical, jobs. By the 1990s, therefore, pay discrimination against women ought to have become a thing of the past. Investigates whether this is so, taking evidence on men and women in their early 30s at two points during this period.

### Notes

“The disadvantages of being female in the full-time British labour market seem to weigh less heavily in the 1990s than they did at the end of the 1970s” (Paci et al., 1995, p. 6)
