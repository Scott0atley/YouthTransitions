### Abstract

```
This study uses data from the National Child Development Study to examine how experiences during childhood are linked to a wide variety of outcomes in adulthood. A cluster of childhood experiences (poverty, family disruption, and contact with the police) are given specific attention. One of the main goals is to examine the extent to which social exclusion and disadvantage is transmitted across generations and across the life-course.
