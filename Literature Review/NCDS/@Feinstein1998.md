### Abstract

```
T ony Blair has famously made education the priority of his government. Policies for enhancing educational attainment include promises to reduce class sizes, expand the provision of nursery schooling, increase the involvement of parents in the education of their children and support lifetime learning. Economists have already undertaken considerable research using longitudinal data to shed light on these issues. This article will describe this research, asking whether or not it supports the emphasis on education and the policy instruments chosen.

### Notes

“Although parental interest in education tends to be much greater for parents in professional occupations it is the interest... that explains educational performance... rather” (Feinstein, 1998, p. 99)
