### Abstract

```
This paper presents data from the National Child Development Study which examine the extent to which the same children performed relatively well, or poorly, at each stage of their school career.
```

### Notes

“The children whose attainment improved considerably in comparison with their peers were often fairly similar in their characteristics to those children who obtained high scores at each age; for example they were from non-manual social classes, with parents of a higher educational level, from the South of England and in small families. Conversely those whose performance deteriorated considerably were more similar to the group who consistently obtained low scores.” (Essen et al., 1978, p. 143)
