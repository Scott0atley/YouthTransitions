### Abstract

```
Human capital theory suggests educational investments are made based on expected returns over the lifetime. Most other work in this field, particularly using British data, is based on demand models estimated in reduced form, with no earnings measures, or crudely constructed earnings measures, based on one or two earnings observations per individual.
```

### Notes

“Our results show that expected earnings profiles vary according to observed ability and educational choice.” (Johnson, 2002, p. 233)

“Social class is found to be a particularly strong determinant of education demand. The lower social classes are much less likely to undertake post-compulsory education” (Johnson, 2002, p. 246)
