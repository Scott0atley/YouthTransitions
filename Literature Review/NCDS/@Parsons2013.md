### Abstract

```
This resource report highlights how qualitative information from the Mass Observation Archive could be used in tandem with data from the British birth cohort studies. In particular it focuses on the 1958 cohort study and the Mass Observation Project that started in 1981, but also draws on the 1970 and 1946 cohort studies. The report highlights the rich qualitative data that has been collected as part of the Mass Observation Project since 1981. This could be used to generate hypotheses that could then be tested using cohort data and could also be used to provide illustrative material alongside quantitative analyses.
