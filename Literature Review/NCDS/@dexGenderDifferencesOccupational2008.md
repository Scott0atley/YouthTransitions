### Abstract

```
This paper examines the wage growth of British men and women between the ages of 33 and 42 who were employed full time at both of these ages using the 1958 National Child and Development Study. Wage growth is examined in the differences of the log of hourly wage rates reported at the 33 and 42 year old interviews of this cohort study. Men were found to have higher wage growth rewards than women when in higher occupations and be more likely than women to be in these higher wage growth occupations. Women’s wages grew more slowly over the period than men’s wages because they were located disproportionately in lower growth and feminised jobs. Domestic ties did not explain the differences in wage growth for this group, where the occupational penalties of gender widened.
