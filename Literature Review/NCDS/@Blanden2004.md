### Abstract

```
It is clear from existing research that children from poorer backgrounds have worse educational attainments than their better-off peers. What is less clear, however, is the extent to which these differences are caused by income itself rather than parental ability, education, and other aspects of the child’s experience which differ between families but are not a direct result of income. If it is money in itself which makes a difference then increased income inequality among families with children (such as has occurred in recent years in the UK) will lead to increased inequalities in educational attainment.

### Notes

“we find that while the relationship between family income and degree attainment rose throughout the cohorts the relationship between income and low educational qualifications rose and then fell back.” (Blanden and Gregg, 2004, p. 3)
