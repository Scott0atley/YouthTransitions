### Abstract

```
The intergenerational transmission of educational success is a key driver of the persistence of social class differences and a barrier to equality of opportunity. Although each child should be supported to achieve his or her objectives, differences in the capabilities of families to take advantage of educational opportunities exacerbate social class differences and limit actual equality of opportunity for many. Understanding the causes of this transmission is key to tackling both social class inequality and to expanding the skill base of the UK economy.

### Notes

“The most important socio-demographic, family-level, distal influences on children’s attainments are parental education and income” (Feinstein et al., 2004, p. 5)
