### Abstract

```
This paper analyses gender wage differentials in full-time employment using recently released data from the National Child Development Study and the British Cohort Study 1970. The paper compares the situations of individuals in their early thirties in 1991 and 2000 and the position of full-time employees in NCDS as the cohorts aged between 33 and 42. The distribution of individuals’ experiences of unequal pay is emphasised by comparing distributions of gender differentials of an “index of unequal treatment”. Passing from age 33 to 42, unequal treatment increased substantially, across the whole distribution.
