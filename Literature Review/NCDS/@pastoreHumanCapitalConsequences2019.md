### Abstract

```
What is the value added of grammar schools? This paper disentangles the effect of selection into an academic rather than a vocational track from that of individual background on long-term human capital. Identification relies on a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, using entry test scores for grammar schools, selective secondary schools in England, and estimating discontinuities in school assignment directly from the data. We find that for the marginal admitted student, grammar attendance positively affects educational attainment, likely due to higher-ability peers, while adult labour market outcomes and health are not affected. Observed differences in human capital by school type can largely be traced back to background.
