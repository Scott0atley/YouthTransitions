### Abstract

```
Despite the small number of pupils involved, the ‘grammar school question’ is still fiercely debated among academics and politicians. Proponents of state-funded selective schooling invariably claim it enhances social mobility by providing the opportunity for bright children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to access a high-quality secondary education alongside other similarly high-ability children, with positive impacts on educational attainment and subsequent life trajectories. Arguments against the system include its apparently divisive nature, the unfairness of the 11+ examination and, above all, evidence that suggests the system depresses overall educational achievement within a general catchment area and has a particularly negative effect on the poorest children in that area.

### Notes

“there was no statistically significant advantage in the chances of accessing an ‘elite’ university for students from grammar schools.” (Furlong and Lunt, 2020, p. 13)
