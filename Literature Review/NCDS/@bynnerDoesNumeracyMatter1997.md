### Notes

“Although there is some evidence that at school the gap in numeracy skills between boys and girls may be reducing (DfEE,1996), if two of the main areas of employment entered by women increasingly demand numeracy skills, then the need to close the numeracy gender gap takes on added importance.” (Bynner and Parsons, 1997, p. 5)

“The survey gives striking evidence that numeracy does matter. People without numeracy skills suffered worse disadvantage in employment than those with poor literacy skills alone. They left school early, frequently without qualifications, and had more difficulty in getting and maintaining full-time employment. The jobs entered were generally low grade with limited training opportunities and poor pay and prospects.” (Bynner and Parsons, 1997, p. 29)
