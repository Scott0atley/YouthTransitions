### Abstract

```
This paper focuses on pathways to adult disadvantage (or social exclusion) up to age 33 for a cohort of children born in Great Britain in March 1958. A sequence of interrelated analyses that build up a life-course account of the pathways involved in the origins of adult social exclusion are explored.
```

### Notes

“We find fairly compelling evidence that the effects of childhood disadvantage are more powerful for women than for men: pathways to social exclusion are gendered.” (Hobcraft, 2003, pp. -1)
