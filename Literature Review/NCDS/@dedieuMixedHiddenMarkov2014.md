### Abstract

```
Analysing longitudinal declarative data raises many difficulties, such as the processing of errors and missingness in the outcome variable. Moreover, long-term monitored cohorts (commonly encountered in life-course epidemiology) may reveal a problem of time heterogeneity, especially regarding the way subjects respond to the investigator. We propose a Mixed Hidden Markov Model which considers several causes of randomness in response and also enables the effect of a past health outcome to act on present responses through a memory state. Hence, we take into account both errors and missing responses, time heterogeneity, and retrospective questions. We thus propose a Stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm (SEM), which is less time-consuming than usual EM algorithms to perform the estimation of the parameters of our MHMM.
