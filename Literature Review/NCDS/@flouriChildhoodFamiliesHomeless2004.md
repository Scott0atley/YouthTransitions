### Abstract

```
Using longitudinal data from the British National Child Development Study which traced some 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week in March 1958, this study investigated the role of early fatherÕs and motherÕs involvement in social and economic disadvantage (experience of homelessness, state benefits receipt, and subsidized housing) in adult life. Data from 5880 cohort members showed that in women being married was negatively related to all three indicators of disadvantage. In men, large family size in childhood and current psychological distress were positively related to the three indicators of disadvantage. For both genders low educational attainment predicted both living in subsidized housing and receiving state benefits. Both fatherÕs and motherÕs involvement in families of lower socioeconomic status were highly protective against an adult experience of homelessness in sons.
