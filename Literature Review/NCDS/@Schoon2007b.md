### Abstract

```
Drawing on data collected from two longitudinal Cohort Studies following the lives of over 20,000 individuals born in the United Kingdom 12 years apart in 1958 and 1970, respectively, this paper examines antecedents and outcomes of educational and occupational aspirations of young men and women, covering the transition from dependent childhood into independent adulthood. Two analytical models, a Social Reproduction Model and a Developmental-Contextual Model are tested to assess the processes by which family background and the wider socio-historical context inXuence work and family related careers. The Wndings demonstrate the persistent role of gender, social origin and individual agency processes as well as the inXuence of a changing socio-historical context on career development. Results are interpreted with regard to biographical agency processes linking individual lives with social contexts across the life course.

### Notes

“The Wndings demonstrate the persistent role of gender, social origin and individual agency processes as well as the inXuence of a changing socio-historical context on career development. Results are interpreted with regard to biographical agency processes linking individual lives with social contexts across the life course.” (Schoon et al., 2007, p. 78)

“Bias due to attrition of the sample during childhood has been shown to be minimal (Butler, Despotidou, & Shepherd, 1997; Davie, Butler, & Goldstein, 1972; Fogelman, 1983; Fogelman, 1976). Potential bias due to missing variable information is addressed in the section on estimating the model.” (Schoon et al., 2007, p. 82)

“Teenage girls appear to have higher occupational aspirations than boys of the same age, they are more motivated at school and achieve better exam results. Parents expect that their daughters will participate longer in further education then their sons, thus supporting their career endeavours. Nonetheless women are less likely than men to achieve to the same occupational level.” (Schoon et al., 2007, p. 90)
