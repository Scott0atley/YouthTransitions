### Notes

“The 1958 birth cohort or the National Child Development Study (NCDS) began as a study of Perinatal Mortality focussing on just over 17 000 births in a single week in 1958” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 34)

“The school leaving age was raised to 16 yr in 1973 making cohort members part of the first year group required to stay on at school for an extra year.” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 34)

“Followed into adult life, the cohort had reached a life stage marked by major transitions—for example from school or fulltime further education to employment (although unemployment was very high), and from dependent status in their family of origin to independent status as heads of new households. A survey at age 23 (1981) was designed to trace these transitions, and in so doing it differed from earlier follow-ups in obtaining information directly from the cohort member (instead of their parents, usually the mother).” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 34)

“It can be seen that the sample reached at age 23 yr is considerably smaller than at age 16 yr. The main reasons for sample loss over time are individuals moving to a new address and not responding to efforts to trace them. Refusal rates are relatively low but also contribute to sample loss over time. At age 23 yr refusal was 7.1%; at 33 yr, 11.1%; and at 42 yr, 13.2%” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 35)

“Although all births were included, the cohort does not have the ethnic diversity of today’s population” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 39)

“Strengths include the large study sample, extensive data coverage, eight ages studied, use of objective measures, and standardized tests or scales, especially in the earliest phases of follow-up (e.g. for height and cognition).” (Power and Elliott, 2006, p. 39)
