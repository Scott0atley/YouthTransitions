### Abstract

```
This study, using data from 5,689 cohort members of the National Child Development Study, explores the impact of both structure of parenting family and contextual factors on attitudes towards marriage at age 33. Traditional attitudes to marriage were positively related to religiosity and negatively related to high non-verbal skills in childhood and smoking or drinking in adulthood but were unrelated to the structure or background of parental family. The results also yielded some very interesting gender differences. For example, the presence of partner at age 33 signi®cantly predicted traditional attitudes to marriage in women but not in men. In men, by contrast, it was the presence of children at age 33, the absence of quali®cations and current lowsocio-economic status that were associated with traditional attitudes to marriage. The implications of these ®ndings on future family change are discussed. Copyright # 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
