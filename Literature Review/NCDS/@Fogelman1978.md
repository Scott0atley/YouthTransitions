### Abstract

```
Of course, when the Secretaries of State (DES, 1977) wrote the above they had in mind the selection of children to go to a particular type of school, and in this narrow context the statement is true. However, the importance of this change could be illusory if divisions between schools have merely been replaced by selective systems within the schools. Downey & Kelly (1975), for example, have argued that comprehensive education cannot "be undertaken without fundamental re-appraisal of the internal reorganization of the school. If we adopt a system of schools that is based on abandonment of selective procedures, we must look very hard at any such procedures it is proposed to use within the school".
