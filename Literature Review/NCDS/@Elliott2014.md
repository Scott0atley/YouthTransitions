### Abstract

```
The aim of this working paper is to set out an approach to classifying the childhood social class of members of the 1958 British birth cohort study. The specific focus is on the use of mother’s occupation and household tenure, in addition to father’s occupation, in order to create a more meaningful and robust three-category measure of social class that is likely to be of particular utility for those using the newly available qualitative materials now associated with the study. The paper also provides a descriptive insight into the living conditions, during the 1960s, of children from different social classes. By drawing both on the quantitative data collected in 1969, and on retrospective accounts of childhood circumstances collected from cohort members in qualitative interviews in their early fifties, we aim to provide a picture of the diversity of experience of children from different social classes within the cohort.

### Notes

“Despite a clear association between father’s social class and tenure, among the children with manual fathers one-third (33.2%) were in owner-occupied accommodation” (Elliott and Lawrence, 2014, p. 2)
