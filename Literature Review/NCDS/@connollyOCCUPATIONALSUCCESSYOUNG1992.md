### Abstract

```
In 1974, the majority of 16 year old boys in Britain left full-time education, this being the earliest legal opportunity. In the simplest human capital model, variations in years of schooling prior to labour market entry are the driving force behind earnings differentials at given levels of experience. Yet for the majority of young people in Britain this simple model is inapplicable because they have no schooling beyond the compulsory level. It is therefore of interest to see what determines the enormous variation in success in the labour market which befalls this group of young men. We look at those boys who left school at 16 in 1974 and analyse their occupational success in 1981 measured by the average gross hourly earnings (over the male labour force as a whole) in the relevant occupation, obtained from the Department of Employment's New Earnings Survey. The sample we consider is drawn from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) panel which is based on all individuals bom in Britain in the week of March 3-9,1958.
