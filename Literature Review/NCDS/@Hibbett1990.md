### Abstract

```
Y, This paper presents some findings of a study into early adult outcomes of truancy, which was based on the National Child Development Study, a longitudinal survey of all people in GreatBritain born in the week 3rd-9thMarch 1958.It wasfoundthat truancy is associated with lower status occupations, less stablecareer patterns and more unemployment. Among those who were working, former truants' incomes were not lower, but they were considerably less well off once their familysituationwas taken into account.Differencesremained after controlling for the effects of social background, educational ability, poor attendance due to other reasons, and endof-school qualifications. The authors conclude that truancy is a predictor of employment problems, and of a more severe kind than will be experienced by others who share the disadvantagedbackground and low attainment which typify the truant.
