### Abstract

```
The Every Child Matters (ECM) agenda was introduced in the UK, as a policy aiming to improve child outcomes along five broad areas. The categories are Be Healthy, Stay Safe, Enjoy and Achieve, Make a Positive Contribution and Achieve Economic Wellbeing1. The objective therefore, is to move beyond the traditional focus on child academic outcomes, to improve the wellbeing of children in the UK.

### Notes

“The strongest significant correlations that we find are between the cognitive achievement of the children and parents. This pattern tends to increase between early childhood and early adolescence and then stabilise. A one standard deviation increase in the reading (spelling) attainment of NCDS (BCS) parents at age 11 (10) is associated with 27.8% (22.3%) of a standard deviation increase in child attainment around the same age.” (Blanden et al., 2010, p. 2)
