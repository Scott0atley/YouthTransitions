### Abstract

```
Longitudinal datacontained in the National Child Development Study (NCDS)cohort was used in a Department of Education and Science (DES) funded investigation of whether changes of school adversely affect children’s attainment and behaviour. There have been a number of studies which have investigated these effects but the results have been conflicting and confusing. Recently a series of major studieshas shownthat it may be especiallydangerous to draw conclusionsbased on expostfucto data in this field.This research note discussessomeaspects of the researchmethodologyadopted in this study to overcomethe deficiencesof some of the earlier mobilityprojects. Thefindings,based on a series of multivariate analyses, support the view that differences in the academic attainment of children who change school generally existed prior to the move.
