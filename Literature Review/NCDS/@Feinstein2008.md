### Abstract

```
This briefing paper reports findings from an original study of social housing from WW2 to 2003. This wide historical panorama is vital in the study of social housing because so many of the underlying processes and impacts run across generations. By social housing we mean housing owned by local authorities or registered social landlords such as housing associations. We focus on tenure as a key characteristic of housing, distinguishing social housing from private rental and owner occupation in particular. We use data from four UK birth cohort studies, finding that the negative outcomes now commonly associated with social housing are not inevitable or inherent to provision of housing by the public sector. For those born in 1946 social housing was not until more recently a risk factor operating against life chances. For later cohorts we find that social housing has become a substantial risk factor for wide-ranging negative outcomes, both for those who experience social housing in childhood and those who experience social housing in adulthood.
