### Abstract

```
There is no shortage of books about the future of work. This one is well worth reading. It greatly extends and develops Beck’s discussion of the‘destandardization of labor’ in his Risk Society, and makes a contribution which is original, complex, subtle, wide-ranging, sometimes repetitive, but always stimulating.
