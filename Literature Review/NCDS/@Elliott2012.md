### Abstract

```
The full National Child Development Study dataset includes a variety of geographical information which is available for analysis. These data are summarised below. However, much of this information is disclosive and is, consequently, only available via the CLS ‘safe setting’ / or under ’special licence’ (http://www.esds.ac.uk/orderingdata/specialLicence.asp).
