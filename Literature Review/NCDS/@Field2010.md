### Abstract

```
Frank Field was commissioned by the Prime Minister in June 2010 to provide an independent review on poverty and life chances by the end of the year. The aim of the review is to: • generate a broader debate about the nature and extent of poverty in the UK; • examine the case for reforms to poverty measures, in particular for the inclusion of nonfinancial elements; • explore how a child’s home environment affects their chances of being ready to take full advantage of their schooling; and • recommend potential action by government and other institutions to reduce poverty and enhance life chances for the least advantaged, consistent with the Government’s fiscal strategy.
```

### Notes

“It is family background, parental education, good parenting and the opportunities for learning and development in those crucial years that together matter more to children than money” (Field, 2010, p. 5)
