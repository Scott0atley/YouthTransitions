### Abstract

```
Existing data on social mobility in Britain demonstrate a dispa to 4:1 in the relative chances of children from different social class b ending up at the top or bottom of the occupational class system. In an ea it was argued that such disparities should not necessarily be seen as th social advantages or disadvantages associated with different class origin are also consistent with a model of meritocracy in which class differ average levels of ability are reflected in the class destinations achieve from different social backgrounds. That paper has been criticised, both and empirically, and this paper addresses some of these criticisms thr analysis of data from the National Child Development Study. The anal that ability is an important factor influencing social mobility chances, and series of logistic regression and multiple regression models, it demon meritocratic factors (individual effort and ability) outweigh social ad disadvantage factors in predicting the occupational class achieved by o men and women by age 33. The paper ends by answering the analytical made against the earlier paper.
