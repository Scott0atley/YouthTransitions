### Abstract

```
The economic returns of higher education (HE) in terms of enhanced earnings are well established. The wider set of ‘non-economic benefits’ in the areas of health, generic skills and citizenship are less widely recognised. In an earlier report, we presented preliminary findings on the wider benefits, drawing on data collected at age 33 from the National Child Development Study (based on a cohort born in 1958). This report updates the earlier conclusions through new findings from a more extensive analysis involving both the 1958 cohort and the more recent 1970 British Cohort Study cohort (based on a cohort born in 1970). The current analysis incorporates more recent data collected in both cohorts in 2000 and at an older age (1958 cohort). We report findings in five major areas. First, we examine the mobility of graduates. To what extent do some parts of the country gain and lose graduates and graduate types of occupation at the expense of others? We then report findings on the ‘marginal returns’ to higher education in four domains of life: health, labour market, citizenship and values, and parenting.

### Notes

“Graduates were generally less depressed; they also reported a sense of well being that was higher than for people at lower qualification levels.” (Bynner et al., 2002, p. 2)

“Graduates were more tolerant towards other races than other groups with a clear boost attached to gaining a degree.” (Bynner et al., 2002, p. 3)

“graduates tended to read more to their children and for their children to own more books.” (Bynner et al., 2002, p. 3)
