### Notes

“framing the “culture–identity link” with concepts representing three social-structural periods at three levels of analysis (the macro, micro, and psychological). The concept of “identity capital” is derived from this framework, depicting how individuals can negotiate life passages in an increasingly individualistic, complex and chaotic world.” (Côté, 1996, p. 417)

“In particular, the question of the extent to which, and the ways in which, culture and identity are interrelated has not been answered in a systematic and empirically testable manner.” (Côté, 1996, p. 417)

“These levels are: (1) social structure, which can include political and economic systems; (2) interaction, comprising patterns of behaviour that characterize day-to-day contacts among people in socializing institutions like the family and schools; and (3) personality, which encompasses terms like character, self and psyche, including subcomponents like ego identity.” (Côté, 1996, p. 417)

“three interrelated levels of analysis (vertically) are postulated to be associated with constructs representing three periods of social-structural stability/change (horizontally), producing a three-by-three typology.” (Côté, 1996, p. 418)

“At the interactional level, three patterns corresponding to the above social-structural changes can be identified with regard to socializing institutions such as the family and school.” (Côté, 1996, p. 418)

“These patterns were postulated by Margaret Mead (1970) to denote how social change affects the relationship between socializers and socializees, thereby influencing cultural continuity” (Côté, 1996, p. 418)

“Associated with pre-modern societies are postfigurative cultures in which the relations between parents and their offspring are governed by traditional norms that are beyond questioning by either parent or child” (Côté, 1996, p. 418)

“Table 1 A framework for the culture–identity link: superordinate concepts” (Côté, 1996, p. 418)

“The cofigurative culture is one in which the intergenerational linkage becomes tenuous and offspring look to non-traditional sources for components of their adult identities (e.g. among their contemporaries).” (Côté, 1996, p. 419)

“Lastly, in the prefigurative culture there is less conception of what the future holds for offspring, and the life-experiences of parents are of less use to offspring, so their guidance is less highly regarded.” (Côté, 1996, p. 419)

“For example, the term “identity” has been used in many ways to emphasize different facets of human self-definition (cf., Gecas and Burke, 1995). However, the social structure and personality perspective suggests the following taxonomy: (1) that the term social identity designate the individual’s position(s) in a social structure; (2) that the concept of personal identity denote the more concrete aspects of individual experience rooted in interactions (and institutions); and (3) that the notion of ego identity refer to the more fundamental subjective sense of continuity which is characteristic of the personality.” (Côté, 1996, p. 420)

“Social-identity formation is postulated to differ in each type of society, such that according to the particular cultural prototype it tends to be ascribed in pre-modern societies, achieved in early-modern societies, and managed in late-modern ones” (Côté, 1996, p. 420)

“At the level of interaction (i.e. the interpersonal world where culture and individual meet), personal identity is largely heteronomous, then individuated, and then image-oriented as we move through the three types of societies.” (Côté, 1996, p. 421)

“Finally, at the level of character, two components of ego identity can be classified: “structure” and “process.” Ego identity structure generally refers to “how experience is handled as well as . . . what experiences are considered important” by an individual (Marcia, 1993a, p. 3), while ego identity process refers to the manner by which the ego forms its identity as a distinct entity in relation to its object world.” (Côté, 1996, p. 421)

“Table 2 Cultural prototypes of identity formation patterns constituting the culture–identity link” (Côté, 1996, p. 421)

“Western cultural development is proceeding more like a rudderless ship than as a vessel that will transport its occupants safely to their desired destinations (cf., Giddens, 1991)” (Côté, 1996, p. 423)

“It is reasonable to assume that a certain proportion of individuals in most societies actively strategize to maximize their life-course outcomes.” (Côté, 1996, p. 424) RAT based/inspired

“In my view, the concepts of human capital and cultural capital are useful but neither comprehensively describes what seems to be necessary for individuals to successfully negotiate the vagaries of life passages in late-modern society.” (Côté, 1996, p. 424)

“ocial institutions like education, the workplace and the family are often poorly regulated, inadequately linked, or are actually failing, so tradition-based contingency patterns cannot be relied upon uncritically. Furthermore, strong status or “tribal” differentiations have emerged that are based on class, race, gender, and age. Each of these status differentials introduces an arena where “identity politics” are now being played out at both the macro- and micro-political levels. Consequently, individuals seem to require more personal resources and a heightened awareness to make their way through this uncharted and often hostile territory. I see these attributes as constituting more general forms of “capital” than either human capital or cultural capital, and as key components of contemporary self-definition. Hence, the term “identity capital” seems appropriate to describe the wherewithal individuals use when engaging in transactions as they attempt to negotiate the tricky passages created by the obstacles of late-modern society.” (Côté, 1996, p. 424)

“Table 3 Most advantageous social-class mobility/reproduction resources” (Côté, 1996, p. 424)

“Cultural capital can be useful in gaining or sustaining membership in high status culture, and may be a source of personal development and fulfillment, but cultural/aesthetic skills are often not well rewarded in the technocracy, and “old class” advantage dwindles as it is transferred through successive generations.” (Côté, 1996, p. 425)

“Indeed, a more “diversified portfolio” that includes psychosocial skills may be necessary if an “intelligent strategist” is to be at the helm of behaviour (cf., Giddens, 1994, p. 7). The key is for the individual to form and sustain an identity pragmatically situated in a social/occupational matrix. Accordingly, the individual invests in a certain identity (or identities) and engages in a series of exchanges at the level of identity with other actors.” (Côté, 1996, p. 425)

“However, it must be stressed that this is generally an abstract, over-arching concept intended to guide empirical research, rather than to be directly operationalized as one discrete construct. Thus, its value can be assessed in terms of how well it generates research questions regarding its various empirical manifestations (discussed below) and how much it helps interpret results (including meta-analyses), rather than being the object of singular, direct measurement. Its status is therefore much the same as Erikson’s general concept of ego identity, which seems to emphasize a psychological dimension of coping, while identity capital emphasizes more of a social-psychological one” (Côté, 1996, p. 425)

“The most successful investors in the identity markets presumably have portfolios comprising two types of assets, one more sociological and the other more psychological.” (Côté, 1996, p. 426)
