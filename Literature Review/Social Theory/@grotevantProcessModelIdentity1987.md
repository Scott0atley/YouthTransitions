### Abstract

```
A process model for conceptualizing identity formation that is developmental, contextual, and life-span in scope is proposed. The framework is consistent with an Eriksonian approach to identity but focuses more specifically on the process of identity exploration. The framework consists of four major components: individual characteristics brought to bear on the identity process, contexts of development, the identity process in specific domains (e.g., occupation, ideology, values, relationships), and interdependencies among the identity domains. Current research in each area is briefly reviewed, and recommendations for future research are outlined.
