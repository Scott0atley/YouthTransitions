### Abstract

```
This paper argues that the dominance of linear models has led many sociologists to construe the social world in terms of a "general linear reality." This reality assumes (1) that the social world consists of fixed entities with variable attributes, (2) that cause cannot flow from "small" to "large" attributes/events, (3) that causal attributes have only one causal pattern at once, (4) that the sequence of events does not influence their outcome, (5) that the "careers" of entities are largely independent, and (6) that causal attributes are generally independent of each other. The paper discusses examples of these assumptions in empirical work, considers standard and new methods addressing them, and briefly explores alternative models for reality that employ demographic, sequential, and network persp

### Notes

This paper argues that the dominance of linear models has led many sociologists to construe the social world in terms of a ‘‘general linear reality’’. This reality assumes (1) that the social world consists of fixed entities with variable attributes, (2) that cause cannot flow from ‘‘small’’ to ‘‘large’’ attributes/events, (3) that causal attributes have only one causal pattern at once, (4) that the sequence of events does not influence their outcome, (5) that the ‘‘careers’ of entities are largely independent, and (6) that causal attributes are generally independent of each other

The phrase ‘‘general linear reality’’ denotes a way of thinking about how society works. This mentality arises through treating linear models as representations of the actual social world.

Marx, Weber, and work deriving from them in historical sociology all approach social causality in terms of stories, rather than in terms of variable attributes.

The contrast between these assumptions and those of GLR suggests that theorists may reject empirical sociology because of the philosophical approach implicit in representational use of the GLM.

a central assumption of the GLM is that the world consists of entities with attributes. Entities are fixed; attributes can change.

The entities/attributes model for reality can best be understood by contrasting it with its most common alternative. A historical narrative is organised around a central subject (Hull 1975). This central subject may be a sequence of events, a transofrmation of an entity or set of entities into a new one, or indeed a simple entity.

Delineating a central subject and the relevant events - the task of coligation (McCullagh 1978) - is the fundamental problematic of classical historiography.

what GLR saw as variables describing entities become events occuring to central subjects.

a profound difficulty witht eh fixed entities approach; it ignores entity change through birth, death, amalgamation, and division.

GLR assumes that causality flows from big to small or between attributes of equivelant size. Cause can never flow from small to large, from the arbitrary to the general, from the minor event ot the major development.

The assumption of monotonic causal flow begins with the assumption of ‘‘constant relevance’’. A given cause is equally relevant at all times because the linear transoformation, in most models, doesn’t change over time periods

a theoretical belief in what I shall call the unity of time-horizon - donting the minimum length of time in which a meaningful change in a variable can be observed

the uniform time-horizons assumption can most easily be seen in time series analysis, where a simple GLM is estimated on a single entitty using successive years as different cases

Not only do these causal flow assumptions disable GLR-typ analysis of microgeneration of macrostructure, they also prevent GLR from recognising small events that assume decisive importance because of given structural conditions

For many theorists, the most problematic assumption of GLR-based empiricism is its insistence that a given attribute have one and only one effect on another attribute within a given study

a fundamental assumption of GLR is that the order of things does not influence the way they turn out

other independence assumptions of the GLR cocnern cases and variables

the first is that there is not ‘‘excessive’’ dependence between elements in a given row of the data matrix X. By increasing parameter variance, collinearity makes the GLM unable to distinguish the effects of variables closely related to one another. The GLR proscription of collinearity directly violates the view, common among theoriests that social determinants lie in closely related bundles.

Correlated error terms are a second statistical problem with conceptual implications. Corrlated errors usually arise through temporally or spatially structured data.

perhaps the most important independence assumption of GLR, however, involves the casewise independence of the dependent vairbale, assumed in the assertion that the independent variables determine the dependent variable up to an error term

a final independence presupposition of GLR is that the causal meaning of a given attribute cannot, in general, depend on its context in either space or time. Its effect does not change as other variables change around it, nor is its causal effect redfined by its own past.

the general linearl model is a powerful tool for empriical reserach. And effective users recognise that there is in fact, no warrant for treating it as a model for social causality. Rather, the GLM tests substantive models of social reality on the assumption that those models entail linear regularitiyes in observed data.

many sociologists treat the world as if social causality actually obeyed the rules of linear transofmrations
