### Abstract

```
Using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), this study examines how different combinations of aspirations, expectations and school achievement can influence students’ future educational behaviour (applying to university at the age of 17–18). The study shows that students with either high aspirations or high expectations have higher school achievement than those with both low aspirations and low expectations. Furthermore, complete alignment between high aspirations, high expectations and high achievement is the most important predictor of future educational behaviour among students. However, it is also found that low expectations do not negatively impact students’ future behaviour when they have high aspirations accompanied with high school achievement. Additionally, the study finds significant ethnic differences in favour of white students at GCSE level, but that these differences are reversed in relation to applying to university at the age of 17–18.

### Notes

“The study shows that students with either high aspirations or high expectations have higher school achievement than those with both low aspirations and low expectations.” (Khattab, 2015, p. 731)

“Additionally, the study finds significant ethnic differences in favour of white students at GCSE level, but that these differences are reversed in relation to applying to university at the age of 17–18.” (Khattab, 2015, p. 731)

“Some of these studies have pointed out that some students (e.g. working class) tend to hold high aspirations even beyond what the labour market can support (St Clair et al., 2013), which has led the researchers to question the assumption among politicians and policy makers that raising aspirations will enhance educational achievement (St Clair & Benjamin, 2011; Carter-Wall & Whitfield, 2012; Gorard et al., 2012).” (Khattab, 2015, p. 732)

“Family and community social capital can emerge as an important resource in raising educational aspirations, thereby upholding student beliefs in their ability to realise their aspirations and, eventually, reach their goals (Schneider & Stevenson, 1999).” (Khattab, 2015, p. 734)

“the parent–child relation is highly sensitive to the social and economic status of the family (Hill & Craft, 2003). Different classes emphasise different values, possess different levels of resources and human capital and have different parenting styles” (Khattab, 2015, p. 734)

“Disadvantaged parents (e.g. working class) do not always possess the knowledge or resources to help their children convert the high aspirations into actions and future achievement.” (Khattab, 2015, p. 734)

“This analysis suggests that we should take both aspirations and expectations into account when examining school performance. Both of them are important as suggested by previous studies (Alexander et al., 1975; Jencks et al., 1983; Marjoribanks, 1998)” (Khattab, 2015, p. 745)
