### Abstract

```
There is general agreement between methodologists, research societies and research funders that high-quality empirical social science needs high-quality data sources and an appropriate supporting infrastructure (UK Data Forum, 2013). In the United Kingdom, and in many other nations, there is an increasing volume of large-scale social surveys designed to support secondary data analyses, which are made available to researchers through national data archives1. These surveys can either be cross-sectional or longitudinal and are usually conducted at either the household or individual level. In the United Kingdom, in particular, the substantial scale and extensive supporting infrastructure of many large-scale multi-purpose social surveys makes them especially appealing for sociological research.
