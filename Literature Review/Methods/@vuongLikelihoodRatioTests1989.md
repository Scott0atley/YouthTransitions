### Abstract

```
In this paper , we propose a classical approach to model selection. Using the Kullback-Leibler Information measur e , we propose simple and directional likelihood-ratio tests for discriminating and choosing between two compe ting models whether the model s are non­ nested , overlapping or nested and whether both, one, or nei ther is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we ful ly characterize the asym ptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditi ons.

### Notes

“Since Neyman and Pearson (1928) advocated the LR test, it has become one of the most popular methods for testing restrictions on the parameters of a statistical model. It is well-known that minus twice the LR statistic has a limitin g central chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis (Wilks (1938)), and a limiting non-central chisquare distribution under a sequence of local alternatives (Wald (1943)) with a non-ce ntrality parameter equal to that of the Wald statistic (Wald (1943)) and Lagrange Multiplier statistic (Aitchinson and Silvey (1958) , Silvey (1959)” (Vuong, 1989, p. 4)
