### Abstract

```
Cohabitation is a rapidly changing aspect of family life in the United States and Britain. This article describes the demography of cohabitation, considers the place of cohabitation in the kinship system, and speculates on the future of cohabitation. I argue that three processes—cohort replacement, socialization that occurs when children live with cohabiting parents, and social diffusion—will foster continued increases in rates of cohabitation. These processes are also likely to increase variation in the types of cohabiting relationships that couples form. Understanding the meaning of cohabitation in the kinship system requires distinguishing between individuals’ attitudes about their own relationships and the composition of cohabiting unions at the population level.

### Notes

“n real life, it is rarely true that all else is equal. Even if nothing else changes, cohabitation is” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)

“likely to become more common in the United States through the process of cohort replacement.” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)

“Divorced women who disapproved of divorce when they were married become more liberal in their attitudes about divorce once they have experienced it themselves (Thornton, 1985).” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)

“The meaning of cohabitation is likely to continue to change, however, as the population who cohabits becomes more variable in the reasons for cohabiting. It is unlikely that cohabitation will become an alternative to marriage in the sense that marriages will disappear. Roughly 90% of adults in the United States will marry, although marriage is still more common for highly educated people than for those with less schooling (Goldstein & Kenney, 2001).” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)

“Similarly, in Britain, nearly 90% of women born in the late 1950s are likely to marry, but marriage rates may be lower for those born more recently (Ermisch & Francesconi, 2000b; Murphy & Wang, 1999). Yet, economic insecurity and uncertainty about marriage in light of high divorce rates mean that marriage is unattainable for some people. Cohabitation provides some of the intimacy and support provided in close relationships even if the partners are unprepared or are unable to make the commitment required in marriage.” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)

“Cohabitation is also not an alternative to marriage in the sense that cohabitation is not on an equal footing with marriage in the kinship system.” (Seltzer, 2004, p. 926)
