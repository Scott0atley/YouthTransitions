### Abstract

```
In class analysis the main regularities that have been established by empirical research are not ones of long-term class formation or decomposition, as envisaged in Marxist or liberal theory, but rather ones that exhibit the powerful resistance to change of class relations and associated life-chances and patterns of social action. If these regularities are to be explained, theory needs to be correspondingly reoriented, and must abandon functionalist and teleological assumptions in favour of providing more secure micro-foundations. This argument is developed and illustrated in the course of an attempt to apply rational action theory to the explanation of persisting class differentials in educational attainment.

### Notes

- `Must abandon functionalist and teleological assumptions in favour of providing more secure micro-foundations`
    
- `Apply rational action theory to the explanation of persisting class differentials in educational attainment`
    

- `Class analysis 'does not entail a commitment to any particular theory of class' but, rather, provides a context in which 'different and indeed rival theories' may be formulated and assessed (Goldthorpe and Marshall 1992)`
    
- `Theory as here understood is that it should have explanatory force`
    
- `Macrosocial regularities, expressing salient features of the class stratification of modern societies, have been empirically demonstrated. But, thus far, these regularities have been left opaque.`
    
- `The widening of educational opportunity and its supposed effects in weakening the influence of class on individual life chances plays a central role in liberal theory; and an attempt to explain why liberal expectations in regard to class and education have not been met might in turn point the way to accounting for similarly failed expectations in other respects`
    

`Rational action theory and class analysis`

- `The supposition that macrosocial change could be understood without serious analysis of the orientations, goals, and conditions of the action of individuals left both theories alike seriously lacking in 'micro' foundations`
    
- `Starting from an acceptance of methodological- though not ontological- individuals`
    
    - `All social phenomena can and should be explained as resulting from the action and interaction of individuals`
        

`Summary`

`Goldthorpe advocates for a rational action approach to understanding class differentials in educational attainment over the traditional functionalist explanations that are based upon teleological assumptions. Macrosocial change is devoid of any micro foundations, making it difficult to assess or analyse the orientations, goals and conditions of the actions of individuals. If we assume that all social phenomena can and should be explained as a result from the action and interaction of individuals, micro-foundations will lead to more attractive answers to macrosocial change.`
