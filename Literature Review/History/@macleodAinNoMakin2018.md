- `Schools serving working class neighbourhoods are more regimented and emphasise rules and behavioural control`

        - `Academic performance is then turned back into economic capital by the acquisition of superior jobs`
            
    - `Bourdieu’s theory consists of four main points. First, distinctive cultural capital is transmitted by each social class. Second, the school systematically valorises upper-class cultural capital and depreciates the cultural capital of the lower classes. Third, differential academic achievement is retranslated back into economic wealth— the job market remunerates the superior academic credentials earned mainly by the upper classes. Finally, the school legitimates this process “by making social hierarchies and the reproduction of those hierarchies appear to be based upon the hierarchy of ‘gifts,’ merits, or skills established and ratified by its sanctions, or, in a word, by converting social hierarchies into academic hierarchies.”`
        
    - `Children's academic performance is more strongly related to parents educational history than to parents occupational status`
        
    - `Class based differences in cultural capital tend to have a decreasing importance as one ascends the educational ladder`
        
    - `Schools are seen as part of a larger social universe of symbolic institutions that, rather than impose docility and oppression, reproduce existing power relations subtly via the production and distribution of a dominant culture that tacitly confirms what it means to be educated`

`Summary`

`Macleod argues that occupational aspirations are the missing and mediating link between socioeconomic patterns, and individuals at the cultural level play a crucial role in the reproduction of class inequality. Aspirations and opportunity are hitherto central to the educational mortality facing the working class. The problem with education is not that lower class children are inferior in some way; the problem is that by the definitions and standards set by the school they are evaluated as inferior. An essential part of social stratification that people forget is that social reproduction requires individuals within the stratified social order to accept their own position and the inequalities that they face as legitimate. Inequality thus can be legitimatised. As Giroux states schools are ''situated within a network of power relations from which they cannot escape''. Bourdieu's argument that subjective hopes should be modest based on slim objective chances works for the Hallway Hangers but not for the Brothers- acceptance of the achievement ideology is woven into racial discrimination being pointed to as a reason for their current class position- this is based upon their own conceived social order in antithesis to the Hallway Hangers.`
