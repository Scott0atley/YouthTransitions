### Abstract

```
This Briefing looks at broad trends in young people’s experiences of education during the 1980s and 1990s and locates them in the context of very considerable social, economic and policy change. It considers trends that were common throughout Britain, and also the extent to which these varied across the national territories. The findings come from an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded research project entitled Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland 1984-2002 (the EYT project).The empirical evidence about young people’s experiences comes from time-series data derived from the England and Wales Youth Cohort Study (YCS) and the Scottish School Leavers Surveys (SSLS).
