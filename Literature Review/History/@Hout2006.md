### Abstract

```
In RC28’s plenary session at the World Congress in Brisbane (10 July 2002), a group of about 40 RC members collectively took stock of the empirical generalizations and conceptual developments that can be traced to the activities of the research committee. The session was billed as a discussion of a collective research agenda for the future, but it quickly became clear that we could not specify a future until we agreed on our past, that is, what we have learned up till now. The exchange was very engaging. Some generalizations and ideas drew assent quickly, but most spawned discussion. Some were nominated only to be withdrawn after the consensus in the room contradicted the nomination. For example, we moved the “MMI” hypothesis1 from “empirical generalization” to “concept” after several speakers cited exceptions to MMI’s predictions but affirmed the usefulness of those predictions as a guide to research.

### Notes

“In completing the project, he learned – from analyses of 85 prestige studies from 60 countries (13 of them involving replications over time) – that prestige hierarchies were basically invariant through space and time. The correlation between the scores obtained in each study with the standard scale constructed from them ranged from .68 to .97; the average correlation was .91. Treiman subsequently reported these and further analyses in Occupational Prestige in Comparative Perspective (1977).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 4)

“Men and women tend to be segregated into different occupations and into different jobs within occupations and workplaces. Furthermore, the more fine-grained the measure, the greater is the level of gender segregation (Baron and Bielby 1984; Tomaskovic-Devey 1996).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 5)

“This is the central finding in Blau and Duncan’s seminal book, The American Occupational Structure (1967), replicated by Featherman and Hauser in Opportunity and Change (1978), and extended to other countries by several authors, most notably Treiman and Ganzeboom (1990; also see Hope 1985; Hout 1989; Ishida 1992). Prior to Blau and Duncan’s specification of the attainment process, it was generally thought that the two propositions were contradictory and mutually exclusive. Education must either promote mobility or reproduction. But within the formal model of their path analysis, it is rather easy to see how education – due to its central role in occupational achievement – can foster both mobility and reproduction” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 12)

“Men born before 1930 attained far more education than did women born about that time. This male educational advantage began to abate in most industrialized countries around the end of World War II as women born in the 1930s narrowed the education gap (a remarkable development considering that men’s educational attainments were rising faster than ever in most countries).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 14)

“The results of the research committee have supported some predictions of modernization theory but called many other of its predictions into question. Essays by Goldthorpe (1964) and Treiman (1970) over thirty years ago critiqued this paradigm and called for a broad empirical assessment of its predictions. The intervening research record will show few trends that accord well with the modernization theorists. Research by Hout (1988) and DiPrete and Grusky (1990) found rising levels of universalism in status attainment and intergenerational mobility over time, and declining levels of ascription, in particular as it applies to race (Hout 1984). Meanwhile Ganzeboom, Luijkx, and Treiman (1989) found generally rising levels of achievement over the 20th century for a large set of countries (though this finding is contested – see Erickson and Goldthorpe 1992), while Treiman and Yip (1989) found that the ratio of achievement to ascription is generally higher among more industrialized countries.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 16)

“Rob Mare (1980) noted that the association between origins and destinations arises through a process that is composed of many steps. At any step along the way from the beginning of schooling till ultimate school leaving, class or status can come into play in the decision to continue or to stop – a decision that could, in principle, be made either by the student or the school. Ultimately the correlation between origins and education is the (nonlinear) accumulation of these local effects of origin on each transition. Boudon (1974) had previously argued for disaggregating the educational attainment process into its constituent steps, but it was Mare who specified the aggregation / disaggregation most fully and explicitly.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 17)

“Raftery and Hout (R&H) (1993) put forth the hypothesis that privileged groups have interest in their own children’s success but little or no interest in the existence or size of class differentials per se. Thus, R&H supposed, class barriers will persist as long as some high-origin individuals do not successfully attain some educational threshold, but that privileged parents will not take action to limit the achievements of other peoples’ children once all theirs have attained the stated goal” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 18)

“Schools where all students study the same subjects with the same intensity have less variance in educational achievement test scores and labor market outcomes than we see in” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 20)

“schools that teach different students different subjects or the same subjects with different intensity.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 21)

“10) Vocational training and certification in secondary school smooth school-to-” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 21)

“work transitions.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 21)

“The Shavit-Müller school-to-work project was organized around Rosenbaum and Kariya’s (1989) research into the communications between secondary school placement counselors and human resources people at prospective employers. They focused on the correlation between education and first job status, and described how counselors and human resources managers developed relationships of trust and information that guided the school-to-work transitions of Japanese secondary school leavers” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 21)

“Further research by Müller and Gangl (2003) has found the above generalization also to be true when the dependent variable is the probability of early unemployment. Further confirming evidence comes from Van der Velden and Wolbers (2003).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 22)

“Poverty rates are generally lower in strong welfare states” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 22)

“(Rainwater (1991), Jzntti et al (1994), Brady (2003a, 2003b), Heady, Krause & Muffels (1999), Lewin and Stier (2000), Jesuit, Rainwater and Smeeding (2001), Stier and Lewin (2001), and Whelan, Layte, Maître, and Nolan (2001)). Brady (2003a) and Whelan et al. (2001) in particular have done innovative methodological work in this area by showing the resiliency of this generalization to alternative definitions of poverty.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 23)

“Women’s careers are more continuous in countries that provide the highest support for working mothers (Stier, Lewin-Epstein and Braun (2001)), but policies which successfully reduce the incompatibility between work and family do not necessarily reduce the mother’s economic dependence on her male partner (Stier and Mandel (2003)).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 23)

“Strong Welfare States Smooth the Dynamics of the Socioeconomic Life Course by Buffering the Impact of Mobility Events. The dynamics of this effect are implicit in the motivating idea – “social insurance.” Without insurance, disruptions to workers’ careers lead to more desperation in job searches. Seekers tend to satisfice when they should be maximizing, i.e., they tend to take the first acceptable job they find instead of searching more extensively for a better one. Insurance provides the sustenance job seekers need in order to search long enough to achieve an optimal outcome (Fritzell and Henz (1999); Heady, Krause and Muffels (1999); McManus and DiPrete (2000); DiPrete (2002)).” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 24)

“Welfare States and Labor Markets Affect Occupational Mobility via their Impact on the Process of Vacancy Creation in the Labor Market.” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 24)

“irm-level changes in labor demand drive structural change at the industry level and, in turn, job mobility (DiPrete, Maurin, Goux and Tåhlin (2001)” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 24)

“Welfare state and labor market structures affect social mobility via their impact on the size of the self-employment sector” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 28)

“This finding has been substantiated in several papers including Kraus (1992), McManus (1997), Luber and Mueller (1999), Shavit and Yuchtman-Yaar (2000), Model et al. (2000), Robert and Bukodi (2001), Ishida (2001), Sandefur and Park (2002), and other contributions to the forthcoming edited volume on self-employment by Mueller and Arum” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 28)

“Marital homogamy is found in every country. However, there is considerable heterogeneity both in the extent of homogamy and in country-specific trends” (Hout and DiPrete, 2006, p. 29)
