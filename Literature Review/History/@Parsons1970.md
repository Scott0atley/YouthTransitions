### Abstract

```
This paper attempts both to “bring up to date” the author’s conception of social stratification as set forth in two previous general papers written in 1940 and 19S3, and to broaden the field of consideration by giving special attention to the forces pressing toward equality in various respects, as well as the bases of inequality. The position taken is that the erosion of the legitimacy of the traditional bases of inequality has brought to a new level of prominence vulue-commitment to an essential equality of status of all members of modern societal communities. Inequalities. among units of societal structure which are essential in such fields as economic productivity, authority and power, and culturally bused competence, must be justified in terms of their contribution to societal functioning. The balancing of the respects in which all members of the societal community and many of its collective subunits must be held to be equal with the imperatives of inequality constitutes one of the primary foci of the problem of integration in modern society. A few suggestions about the mechanisms by which this integrative process can operate are presented.
