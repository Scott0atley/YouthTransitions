### Notes

“Failure to take into account the fact that skill is intrinsically a multidimensional object may misguide both research and the design of social policy.” (Carneiro et al., 2007, p. 3)

“We find that an overall measure of non-cognitive skill is important for a host of outcomes, including whether or not an individual stays on at school beyond the age of 16, whether they have obtained a degree by age 42, employment status at age 42, work experience between ages 23 and 42, wages at age 42, smoking at age 16, truancy before age 16, exclusion from school, teenage pregnancy, involvement with crime (ages 16 and 42), and health at age 42” (Carneiro et al., 2007, p. 3)

“Further, we show that both cognitive and non-cognitive skills are strongly dependent on family background and other characteristics of the home learning environment, and that this is likely to be for both genetic and environmental reasons.” (Carneiro et al., 2007, p. 4)
