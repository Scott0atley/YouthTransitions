### Notes

“As a result, he says, the adolescent is ... forced inwards towards his own age group. With his fellows, he comes to constitute a small society, one that has its most important interactions within itself, and maintains only a few threads of connections with the outside adult society. (Coleman, 1961: 3).” (Jones, 1986, p. 22)

“eriving from Durkheim (1956), had emphasised the importance of families as "the 'factories' which produce human personalities" (Parsons, 1956: 16).” (Jones, 1986, p. 27)

“Research was beginning to conclude that occupational choice was not only related to aspirations, but was also the product of a differential opportunity structure (Roberts, 1968), and there was some evidence of a separate youth labour market (Carter, 1975; and more recently, Ashton et al., 1982).” (Jones, 1986, p. 33)

“During the 1980s, the major emphasis of the sociology of youth in Britain has moved back to the study of transitions in youth in relation to the labour market” (Jones, 1986, p. 56)

“The term "career" was originally brought into the sociological vocabulary by Weber. Describing a career structure as an essential feature of bureaucracies, he defined it as: A system of "promotion" according to seniority or to achievement, or both. (Weber, 1947: 334) Essentially, a career has been seen in terms of a job structure providing linear and orderly upward progression, as Wilensky points out: A career is a succession of related jobs, arranged in a hierarchy of prestige, through which persons move in an orderly (more-or-less predictable) sequence. (Wilensky, 1960: 523)” (Jones, 1986, p. 137)

“About half of all young people leave school at the minimum age with either rn qualifications or with qualifications below GCE 0 Level. Of those leaving school in 1980 at the age of sixteen, about one third had not found employment by the end of the year (Department of Employment, 1984: 230).” (Jones, 1986, p. 146)

“Ashton's study of youth labour markets concluded that: In general terms, the overall shift in emphasis from a manufacturing to a service eoaxomy has tended to irx cease the number of cpenings in the higher occupational segments while decreasing the number In the lower manual segments.

“result has been a contraction in the opportunities for 16-year old school-leavers entering the local labour-market straight from school, and and incase in the proportion of places for the older school-leaver or college-leaver. (Ashton et al., 1982: 45)” (Jones, 1986, p. 147)

“How widespread is child labour, and who does it? The NCDS asked respondents at 16 years (in 1974) whether they had a job during term time, excluding holiday jobs. When all paid jobs are considered, regardless of the working hours involved, it is seen (Table 7.1) that around half of all respondents had a job of some sort during term.” (Jones, 1986, p. 149)
