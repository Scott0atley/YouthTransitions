### Abstract

```
No clear or strong relationship can be evidenced between qualifications and employer needs. Deficiencies are noted in relevance, access responsiveness, flexibility and cost effectiveness. Some are apparently attributable to the structure of qualifications, others to the content. The studies do not reveal distinct major and minor occupations, nor distinct vertical hierarchies. Level of qualifications is predominantly relevant in recruitment and selection. It seems to become an issue for employers only when it interferes with utilization and supply (Pearson & Marshall, 1996).

“In the BCS70 21-year-old survey, 60% of those with the lowest literacy scores had parents who had gained no education qualifications and 66% had gained no education qualifications themselves: 90% had not gotten beyond the basic 16-year school-leaving standard - the ordinary level ("O Level") of the General Certificate of Education (GCE).” (Bynner, 1999, p. 71)

“Basic skills provide the foundation stones of employability. Without them, the likelihood of being out of the labor force is greatly increased and acquisition of the wider range of work-related skills - the building blocks of” (Bynner, 1999, p. 81) Good quote tbh

“employability - is also impeded.” (Bynner, 1999, p. 82)
