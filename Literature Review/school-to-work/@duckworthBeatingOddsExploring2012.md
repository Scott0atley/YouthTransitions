### Abstract

```
Drawing on nationally representative data collected for two age cohorts in the UK, this paper a) assesses the effect of multiple independent socioeconomic risk factors in shaping the transition from school to work; and b) identifies potential protective factors enabling young people to beat the odds. By comparing experiences and findings across two cohorts we assess the generalisability of findings across contexts, i.e. the 2008 and 1980s recessions. The results show that some young people exposed to even severe socioeconomic risks avoid being NEET (not in education, employment or training). Factors that appear to reduce the cumulative risk effect in both cohorts include prior attainment, educational aspirations and school engagement, as well as the social mix of the school environment.

"assesses the effect of multiple independent socioeconomic risk factors in shaping the transition from school to work; and b) identifies potential protective factors enabling young people to beat the odds." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=1))

"include prior attainment, educational aspirations and school engagement, as well as the social mix of the school environment" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=1))

"in 1986 the unemployment rate of 16-25 year olds was 19 per cent, compared to 15.1 per cent in 2008, and 20.5 per cent in 2010" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=2))

"During the 1970s and into the early 1990s, declines in the demand for low-skilled workers were coupled with an increasing demand for labour market flexibility" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=2))

"Not all young people are affected in the same way by the experience of adversity and disadvantage. Some seem to be able to 'beat the odds', to avoid negative outcomes or do better than expected, a phenomenon also referred to as resilience" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=3))

"Research on resilience highlights key factors, such as individual characteristics, support from significant others and the wider social context, that might help young people beat the odds and avoid negative outcomes such as becoming (and remaining) NEET" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=3))

"Mathematics skills in particular have been linked to adult success and play a key role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage (Duncan et al. 2012)." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=3))

"school motivation is associated with successful career development across cultural contexts" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=3))

"Our multivariate analyses control for gender, income, ethnicity and region. We selected these covariates as they can be considered the most exogenous to the staying on decision made at 16 but are nevertheless likely to be associated with educational and occupational choices" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=5))

"Table 3 shows the odds ratios from logistic regressions of young person's main economic activity at 18 on the separate indicators of social risk separately for each cohort." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=7))

"The findings suggest differential risk effects." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=7))

"Despite some specific differences outlined above and discussed in more detail below, the general pattern of results in the social risk factors which predict early economic activity is remarkably similar across the two cohorts" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=7))

"The results confirm previous research, cited above, demonstrating the socially graded nature of school-to-work transitions, namely that those who become NEET come from the most disadvantaged families, while those who continue in full-time education come from relatively more advantaged backgrounds." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=10))

"highlight that specific socioeconomic risks are differentially associated with the various economic activities pursued by young people in the period immediately following compulsory education." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=10))

"Comparison of the BCS and LSYPE cohorts shows a clear shift in the activities of young people, with the expansion of education and the corresponding reduction of labour market participation." ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=10))

_comparison cohorts can produce interesting results like this. ([note on p.10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=10))_

  

"help young people overcome disadvantage and avoid becoming and remaining NEET. demonstrates that prior achievement as well as educational aspirations and school engagement, and school characteristics can" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=10))

"Our study considers mostly dichotomous outcomes, namely being NEET, in full-time education or in employment at age 18. We also consider a more longitudinally defined indicator of NEET status wherein young people are NEET for at least six months between the ages of 16 and 18 (NEET persistence). However, several authors highlight that young people move in and out of risk" ([Duckworth and Schoon 2012:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F6NBTSB4?page=11))
