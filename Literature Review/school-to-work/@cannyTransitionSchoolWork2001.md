### Abstract

```
This paper compares the transition from school to work in the Republic of Ireland and England in the context of different national labour market structures. It draws upon comparable analysis of Irish and English Labour Force Data from 1988 onwards. There are both signi cant differences and points of comparisons in the transition experiences of Irish and English young people. The lack of employment opportunities for young Irish people meant that traditionally the youth labour market was never as strong compared to England. The majority of young Irish people tended to stay on in post-compulsory education. While young English people are now remaining in education in much greater numbers than in the past, they are still deeply attached to the idea of getting a job. This is particularly evident in the growth of student employment. While the transition from school to work in Ireland and England encapsulates greater diversity with now no clear distinction between education and employment, it illustrates the way in which young people have adapted to labour market exibility. However, this has bene ted quali ed rather than unquali ed young people, the latter now facing increased risk of social exclusion and marginalization in both labour markets where the bond between educational attainment and labour market success has tightened.
