### Abstract

```
This article examines how the automation of jobs has shaped spatial patterns of intergenerational income mobility in the United States over the past three decades. Using data on the spread of industrial robots across 722 local labor markets, we find significantly lower rates of upward mobility in areas more exposed to automation. The erosion of mobility chances is rooted in childhood environments and is particularly evident among males growing up in low-income households. These findings reveal how recent technological advances have contributed to the unequal patterns of economic opportunity in the United States today.

The first is by depriving cohorts recently entering the labor market of industrial jobs that used to offer stability and good pay in the past. A second possibility is that children's attainment is harmed by job destruction earlier in the life course, by eroding the ability of families and communities to invest in the young (Ananat et al., 2017; Gassman-Pines et al., 2015)."

These estimates are scaled to reflect the expected percentage decrease (or increase) in adult income from spending one additional year of childhood in a given commuting zone. Because of the later birth of these cohorts (1980-1986), income is here measured at age 26." ([Berger and Engzell 2022:102689](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CYN9IZP8?page=4))

"A central challenge in identifying the impacts of automation is a lack of data on the diffusion of technology. Most studies have consequently adopted an indirect occupationor task-based approach" ([Berger and Engzell 2022:102689](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CYN9IZP8?page=4))

However, we know that the number of robots by 1982 was as low as 6300 nationwide (Office of Technology Assessment, 1984), which allows us to establish that robot use in the early 1980s was negligible" ([Berger and Engzell 2022:102690](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CYN9IZP8?page=5))

"related with our baseline measure. is that the spread of industrial robots may partly be driven by local factors also shaping mobility prospects. The main empirical strategy partly alleviates such concerns by focusing on differences in the exposure to automation, rather than the actual adoption of industrial robots that is likely more endogenous. However, to further address such concerns we deploy the instrumental variable strategy from Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020). Their strategy uses variation in the adoption of robots in five European countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, and Sweden) that are ahead of the U.S. in robotics. Importantly, the rate of robot adoption in European industry is unlikely to be driven by factors that shape mobility outcomes across local labor markets in the United States" ([Berger and Engzell 2022:102690](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CYN9IZP8?page=5))

Mobility differs markedly across areas more and less exposed to industrial automation: a standard deviation higher exposure to industrial robots is associated with a 0.9-1.5-point reduction in upward mobility, the percentile rank that a child from the bottom half of the income distribution can expect to attain in adulthood. This difference corresponds to one tenth of the distance that separates a place like Charlotte from one like San Jose, representing the very bottom and top of the urban mobility hierarchy (Chetty et al., 2014)" ([Berger and Engzell 2022:102696](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CYN9IZP8?page=11))
