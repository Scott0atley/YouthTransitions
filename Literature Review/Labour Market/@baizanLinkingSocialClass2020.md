### Abstract

```
I outline a theoretical background for interpreting the effects of social class on fertility, based on social class and welfare regime theory. Social class differentials lead to different levels of economic wellbeing and security, compatibility of employment and childcare roles, and of gender equality. I hypothesize that class-specific combinations of these variables result in different incentives for and constraints on family formation, and thus different fertility levels. I use the Spanish sample of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Con­ ditions for the years 2004–2015 and event history analysis techniques to analyze second-birth probabilities. A substantial positive effect of social class on second birth probabilities was found. The results also indicated that the mechanisms concerning the effects of class do not work in a monotonic way, and that specific combinations of mechanisms are relevant for each social group. Overall, the analyses showed that social class is not only key to understand intracountry differentials in fertility but also useful to understand the functioning of the welfare regime and its relationship to overall levels of fertility.

It and especially the position in the occupational division of labor, i.e., social class, that is fundamental to the generation of social inequalities (Breen Rottman, 1995; Goldthorpe, 2007). &" ([Baizan 2020:100377](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XBICYYJX?page=1))

"c fertility patterns. ot be narrowly based on how inOf course, the abor markets, and the market mechanisms implied by them, impact fertility decisions. To start with, the very labor market relations and the inequalities they generate are largely shaped by social institutions, the welfare state in particular (Esping-Andersen, 1993, 2015; Kohli, 2007)."

"modern societies amajority of the active population are employees, aerring to the form of the employment contract typical of each occupational class, taking into account both the explicit and implicit features of it. Two dimensions are seen as crucial to determine the form of regulation of employment contracts, which differ by occupation. First, employers face the problem of monitoring the work of employees" ([Baizan 2020:100378](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XBICYYJX?page=2))

"er-level technicians" (Goldthorpe, 2007). consider individual's class positions or household's class positions (Erikson, 1984; Rose & Harrison, 2007). The focus on life chances and consumption standards, as well as the fact that fertility decisions are generally made by couples, would imply a focus on the household's (or couple's) class as the unit of analysis. But this may lead to neglect the particular job conditions experienced by individuals, including the degree of autonomy, work schedules, and job security, that are crucial for role compatibility and for labor force attachment, especially for women. Therefore, the analyses should consider both perspectives, since they are potentially relevant to fertility" ([Baizan 2020:100378](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XBICYYJX?page=2))

"A key point highlighted by much of the literature is that the employment relations associated with each occupational class hold strong implications for inequalities in terms of several dimensions of individuals' economic security, including employment security (i.e., risk mployment), income stability (shortterm fluctuations in earnings), and the level of earnings and its evolution over the life course (Goldthorpe McKnight, 2006). &" ([Baizan 2020:100379](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XBICYYJX?page=3))
