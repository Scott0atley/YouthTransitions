### Abstract

```
The Labour government elected in 1997, which lost power in 2010, was the longest serving Labour administration Britain has ever had. This period saw an enormous expansion of further and higher education, and an increase in the proportion of students achieving school-level qualifications. But have inequalities diminished as a result? We examine the impact of this educational expansion on levels of social class and gender differentials in educational attainment and participation, using the Youth Cohort Study data for the period 1990–2006. We take a novel approach to the presentation of inequalities, examining differentials in the form of 1) Percentage points, 2) Proportionate gaps and finally, 3) Relative rankings in the hierarchy of examination results. We find that social class inequalities have declined since 1997, but more modestly in terms of relative rankings than in terms of proportionate gaps.

### Notes

“We find that social class inequalities have declined since 1997, but more modestly in terms of relative rankings than in terms of proportionate gaps.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 215)

“Subsequently, as the middle classes approach saturation point, the increase in their rate of participation will necessarily slow, allowing the working classes to catch up (Boudon, 1974)” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 216)

“Furthermore, the concept of ‘Maximally Maintained Inequality’ (MMI) (Raftery & Hout, 1993) implies that, when a particular level of education has become universal, class competition will be re-focused on higher levels of education.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 216)

“In a situation of educational expansion, inequalities are also likely to be expressed through greater differentiation at any given educational level. In this situation, factors such as institutional prestige and field of study become increasingly important (Van de Werfhorst & Kraaykamp, 2001).” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 216)

“It is interesting that, while mentioning social class was something of a taboo for New Labour during most of its incumbency, conservative commentators have more recently raised the issue of the low attainments of white working-class boys (Paton, 2008), partly in response to a perceived policy focus on ethnic minority boys” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 216)

“There is a progressive consensus against testing and the accountability agenda (Ball, 2010). This agenda is perceived as damaging for teachers, who lose autonomy, and for children as it is argued that testing impoverishes the curriculum.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 218)

“Every secondary school with a distinct ethos, mission and centre of excellence. (Labour Party Manifesto 2001, p. 17)” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 218)

“David Blunkett famously promised at the 1995 Labour Party conference: ‘Read my lips: no selection, either by examination or interview, under a Labour government’. But later, comprehensive schools were dismissed as ‘monolithic’ (1997 manifesto), ‘bog-standard’ (Alastair Campbell, February 2001) and ‘one size fits all’ (Estelle Morris, 2002).” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 219)

“There is no pain free option of extending opportunity and building a quality higher education system for the many—not just the few—without someone paying for it. (Tony Blair, 14 January 2004, Speech given at IPPR conference on higher education reform)” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 219)

“Epstein (1998) argues that male peer groups can impose a model of masculinity that leaves little room for academic work.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 228)

“it is clear that social class inequalities persist and that they tend to be greater at higher levels of attainment.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 234)

“it is clear that class inequalities are considerably larger than the gender inequalities.” (Sullivan et al., 2011, p. 234)
