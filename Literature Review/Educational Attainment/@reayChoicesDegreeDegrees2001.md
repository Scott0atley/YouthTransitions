### Abstract

```
This paper draws on data from an on-going ESRC project on choice of higher education. It focuses primarily on the experiences of non-traditional applicants to higher education. Although these students are not typical of the entire university entry cohort, their narratives raise important issues in relation to race, class and higher education choice processes. These `success stories' reveal important causes for concern as well as reasons for celebration. In particular, their experiences of the choice process are qualitatively different from those of their more privileged middle-class counterparts, highlighting key class and racial differences and inequalities.

### Notes

(Reay et al., 2001, p. 5) By 1948 the proportion of the 18 year old population entering university was still only 3.7 per cent

(Reay et al., 2001, p. 5) From 1928 to 1947 8.9 per cent of all boys from non-manual backgrounds entered university compared to 1.4 per cent of all boys from manual backgrounds (Glass 1954) (I have this book use it)

(Reay et al., 2001, p. 9) As Giddens (1995) points out, choice is a medium of both power and stratification. Individuals applying to do higher education courses are making very different kinds of choices within very different circumstances and constraints.

(Reay et al., 2001, p. 20) The history of higher education in Britain is one overshadowed by class inequalities (Halsey 1993; Blackburn and Jarman 1993; Egerton and Halsey 1993)
