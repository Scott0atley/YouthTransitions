### Abstract

```
This article assesses the importance of social class in explaining differentials in the educational achievements of minority ethnic pupils in England and Wales. It is found to be a key factor for all groups. The analysis finds significant differences between ethnic groups even when pupils from the same social class background are compared. When disparities within ethnic groups are examined, however, it is found that the effect of moving one place down the social class structure is similar for all ethnicities. This leads to the conclusion that social class operates in a similar way for all ethnic groups without a specifically `ethnic effect' that mitigates its impact in certain groups.

### Notes

“This article assesses the importance of social class in explaining differentials in the educational achievements of minority ethnic pupils in England and Wales. It is found to be a key factor for all groups.” (Rothon, 2007, p. 306)

“This leads to the conclusion that social class operates in a similar way for all ethnic groups without a specifically ‘ethnic effect’ that mitigates its impact in certain groups” (Rothon, 2007, p. 306)

“Family circumstances vary and an assumption that women are all confined to minor or secondary roles is erroneous.” (Rothon, 2007, p. 308)

“Over 40 percent of Afro-Caribbean families in England and Wales are headed by a single parent, usually the mother (Office for National Statistics, 2002). Incorporating the social class position of the mother may be especially important in this case.” (Rothon, 2007, p. 308)

“Family structure varies considerably by ethnicity, and in ethnic groups such as Afro-Caribbeans in England and Wales, it is crucial to take account of the mother’s social class because a great many fathers are absent from the home. It was suggested that for Pakistani and Bangladeshi families where both parents are usually present and where the father is the sole earner in the majority of cases, the traditional schema may work adequately. The finding here was that the combined social class schema gave the best fitting model for all ethnic groups and for both males and females. On this basis, the combined method was employed in the final analysis.” (Rothon, 2007, p. 314)
