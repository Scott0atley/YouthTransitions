### Notes

- What unites the topics is not a preoccupation with a common object of explanation, but rather a common explanatory factor: class
    
- Class analysis attempts to do- explore the relationship between class and all sorts of social phenomena
    
- The most elaborated and systematic theoretical framework for class analysis is found in the Marxist tradition
    
- The concept of ''class structure'' is only one element in class analysis. Other conceptual elements include class formation, class struggle, and class consciousness
    
- I initially focus on class structure because it remains conceptually pivotal to clarifying the overall logic of class analysis
    
- **The parable of the shmoo**
    
- The saga of the shmoo helps to clarify the sense in which the interests of workers and capitalists are deeply antagonistic, one of the core ideas of Marxist class analysis
    
- The generosity of the shmoo is indicated via Figure 1.1

- If the shmoo provides less than bare physical subsistence, it probably has a positive effect on the material interests of both workers and capitalists
    
- Between these two extremes, however, the impact of the shmoo on the material interests of the two classes diverges
    
- The welfare of workers is continuously improved as the generics of shmoos increases
    
- While in real capitalism capitalists do not face the problem of a threat from shmoos, there are episodes in the history of capitalism in which capitalists face obstacles not unlike the shmoo
    
    - Subsistence peasants have a kind of shmoo in their ownership of fertile land
        
- **The concept of exploitation**
    
- Exploitation is a loaded theoretical term, since it suggests a moral condemnation of relations and practices, not simply an analytical description
    
- Class exploitation is defined by three principal criteria
    
    - A) the material welfare of one group of people causally depends on the material deprivations of another
        
    - B) the causal relation in A) involves the asymmetrical exclusion of the exploitered from access to certain productive resources. Typically, this exclusion is backed by force in the form of property rights, but in special cases it may not be
        
    - C) the causal mechanism which translates B) into differential welfare A) involves the appropriations of the fruits of labour of the exploited by those who control the relevant productive resources
        
- Condition A) establishes the antagonism of material interests. Condition B) establishes that the antagonism is rooted in the way people are situated within the social organisation of production
    
- Condition C) establishes the specific mechanism by which the interdependent, antagonistic material interests are generated
    
- If only the first two of these conditions are met, we have what can be called ''nonexploitative economic oppression'' but not ''exploitation''
    
- No transfer of the fruits of labour from the oppressed to the oppressor
    
- The crucial difference between exploitation and nonexploitative oppression is that in an exploitative relation, the exploiter needs to the exploited since the exploiter depends upon the effort of the exploited
    
- Exploitation, therefore, does not merely define a set of statues of social actors, but a pattern of on-going interactions structured by a set of social relations, relations which mutually bind the exploiter and the exploited together
    
- **A note on exploitation as the appropriation of surplus**
    
- The total social product can be divided into two broad categories: one part is needed to reproduce all the inputs used up in production
    
- The other part is a ''surplus''- the amount of the social product beyond the costs of production
    
- If this surplus is appropriated by a group of people other than those who produced it, and this appropriation was not at the behest of the producers, then the producers are generally regarded as ''exploited''
    
- On closer inspection, however, the concept of ''surplus'' is not so simple. The basic problem is providing a clear meaning to the expression ''the costs of producing and reproducing labour power'' for unless this idea is clear, the concept of ''surplus'' is ambiguous
    
- Because of the complexity of understanding the idea of ''surplus'' in terms of a counterfactual notion of competitively determined costs of production, I will generally discuss exploitation in terms of the extraction and appropriation of effort. This way of framing the concept also highlights the linkage between production and exchange which is at the heart of the theory of exploitation.
    
- **Class and exploitation**
    
- Marxist tradition of class analysis, class divisions are defined primarily in terms of the linkage between property relations and exploitation
    
- For some theoretical and empirical purposes, tis simple image of the class structure may be sufficient. For example, if the main purpose of an analysis is to explore the basic differences between the class structures of feudalism and capitalism, then an analysis which revolved entirely around the relationship between capitalists and workers might be adequate
    
- **The problem of the ''middle class'' among employees**
    
- In ordinary language terms this is the problem of the ''middle class''- people who do not own their own means of production, who sell their labour power on a labour market, and yet do not seem part of the ''working class''
    
- **_Authority_**
    
- There are two rationales for treating authority as a dimension of class relations among employees
    
    - The first concerns the role of domination within capitalist property relations
        
        - To ensure the performance of adequate effort on the part of workers, capitalist production always involves an apparatus of domination involving surveillance, positive and negative sanctions, and varying forms of hierarchy
            
    - The second rationale for treating the authority dimension as a criterion for differentiative class locations among employees centres on the relationship between their earnings and the appropriation of surplus
        
        - The strategic position of managers within the organisation of production enables them to make significant claims on a portion of the social surplus in the form of relatively high earnings
            
- The specific mechanism through which this appropriation takes place can be referred to as a ''loyalty rent''
    
- Profitability of capitalist firms that mangers wield their power in an effective and responsible way
    
- **_Skills and expertise_**
    
- Second axis of class differentiation among employees centres on the possession of skills and expertise
    
- Like managers employees who possess high levels of skills/expertise are potentially in a privileged appropriation location within exploitation relations
    
- There are two primary mechanisms through which this can happen.
    
    - First, skills and expertise are frequently scarce in labour markets, not simply because they are in short supply, but also because there are systematic obstacles in the way of increase ding the supply of those skills to meet the requirements of employing organisations
        
        - One important form of these obstacles is credentials
            
    - Second, the control over knowledge and skills frequently also renders the labour effort of skilled workers difficulty to monitor and control. The effective control over knowledge by such employees means that employers must rely to some extent on loyalty enhancing mechanisms in order to achieve desired levels of cooperation and effort from employees with high levels of skills and expertise just as they have to do in the case in managers
        
- **_A map of middle-class class locations_**
    
- Adding position within authority hierarchies and possession of scarce skills and expertise to the fundamental dimension of capitalist property relations generates the map of class locations presented in Figure 1.2

- It is important to stress that this is a map of class locations. The cells in the typology are not ''classes'' as such; they are locations within class relations
    
- By convention the polarised locations- ''capitalists'' and ''workers'' in capitalism - are often called ''classes'' but the more precise terminology would be to describe these as the fundamental locations within the capitalist class structure

- Goldthorpe draws a distinction between two kinds of employment relations
    
    - One based on a labour contract, characteristic of the working classes
        
    - One based on what he terms a ''service relationship'' characteristic of mangers and experts
        
- In the latter employees enter a career structure, not simply a job, and their rewards are in significant ways perspective, rather than simply payments for the labour performed
    
- The main difference between Goldthorpe's conceptual analysis and the one adopted here is, first, that Goldthorpe does not link his analysis of service-class jobs to the problem of exploitation and antagonistic interests, and second, that he treats the authority dimension of managerial potions simply in terms of heightened responsibility, not domination
    
- Nevertheless, Goldthorpe's conceptualisation of class structure taps many of the same relational properties of managerial and expert positions as the conceptualisation adopted in this book
    
- **People not in the paid labour force**
    
- Many people in capitalist societies- probably the majority- do not fill jobs in the paid labour force
    
- To be in a ''location'' within class structure is to have one's material interests shaped by one's relationship to the process of exploitation
    
- There are other mechanisms by which people’s lives are linked to the process of exploitation. Of particular importance are the ways in which family structures and kinship relations link and individual’s material interest to the process of exploration
    
- I will refer to these situations as mediated class locations
    
- Different kinds of class structures will be generated different forms of an ''underclass''. In many parts of the world today and throughout much of human history, the pivotal resource which defined the underclass is land
    
- In contemporary advanced capitalism, the key resource which defines the predicament of the underclass is labour power itself
    
- Understood in this way, the underclass consists of human beings who are largely expendable form the point of view of the logic of capitalism
    
- **Marxist versus Weberian class analysis**
    
- The control over economic resources is central to both Marxist and Weberian class analysis
    
- Posing Marx and Weber as opposites is a bit misleading because in many ways Weber is speaking in his most Marxian voice when he talks about class
    
    - Both Marxist and Weberian approaches differ from what might be called simple gradational notions of class in which classes are differentiated strictly based on inequalities in the material conditions of life. Class is defending relationally.
        
    - Both traditions identify the concept of class with the relationship between people and economically relevant assets or resources
        
    - Both traditions see the causal relevance of class as operating, at least in part, via the ways in which these relations shape the material interests of actors
        
        - What people have imposed constraints on what they can do to get what they want
            
        - Both class concepts involve the causal connection between a) social relations to resources and b) material interests via c) the way resources shape strategies for acquiring income

 The pivotal difference is captured by the contest between the favourite buzz words of each theoretical tradition: life chances for Weberian and exploitation for Marxists

- Weber in (Garth and Mills 1958)
    
    - ''classes'' are not communities; they merely represent possible, and frequent, bases for communal action. We may speak of a ''class'' when 1) a number of people have in common a specific causal component of their life chances, in so far as 2) this comment is represented exclusively by economic interests in the possession of goods and opportunities for income, and 3) is represented under conditions of the commodity or labour markets
        
- This contrast between the Marxist and Weberian traditions of class is summarised in Figure 1.5

- Weberian class analysis revolves around a single causal nexus that works through market exchanges. Marxist class analysis includes the Weberian causal processes, but adds to them a causal structure within production itself as well as an account of the interactions of production and exchange
    
- There are three main reasons who one might ground the concept of class in exploitation rather than simple market-based life chances
    
    - The exploitation cantered class concept affirms the fact that production and exchange are intrinsically linked, not merely contingently relational
        
        - The material interests of capitalists and workers are inherently shaped by the interaction of these two facets of the social relations that bind them together
            
    - Theorising the interests linked to classes as grounded in inherently antagonistic and interdependent practices facilities the analysis of social conflict
        
    - The exploitation cantered class analysis implies that classes can exist in nonmarket societies, whereas Weberian class analysis explicitly restricts the relevance of class to markets
        
        - For Marxist class analysis, the relationships between slave master and slave are instances of class relations because they all involve exploitation linked to property rights in the forces of production
            
- **The empirical agenda of the book**
    
- The empirical studies in this book explore three interconnected problemist class analysis: 1) characteristics of and variations in class structure itself; 2) the relationship between class and gender as aspects of social structure; 3) the linkage between class structure and aspects of class consciousness
    
    - **_Class and gender_**
        
        - Since the late 1970s once of the main challenges to class analysis has come from feminist scholars who have argued for the centrality of gender as an explanatory principle in social theory and research
            
        - Primacy is a tractable issue only with respect to specific explananda, and even then, it is often more fruitful to explore the forms of interaction of different causal processes than to focus on which is ''more important''
            
    - **_Class structure and class consciousness_**
        
        - One of the main reasons for studying class structure is because of its importance in explaining other elements of class analysis, especially class formation, class consciousness and class struggle
            

 **From Grand paradigm battles to pragmatist realism: Twoards an integrated class analysis**

- I see different theerotical traditions as identifying different kinds of causal processes or mechanisms, which they claim have explanatory pwer for particular agends.
    
- The marxist tradition does not constitute a full blow paradigm
    
- What might be called 'pragmatist relaism' has replaced the Grand Battle of Paradigms
    
- **Class as indiviudal attributes**
    
- Among both sociologists and lay public, the principal way that most people understand the concept of class is in terms of indiviudal attributes and life conditions
    
- The key idnividual attribute that is part of class in economically devleoped societies within this appraoch is education, but some sociolgoists also include somewhat more elusive attributes such as cultural resources, social connecteds and even indiviudal motiviations
    
- While most reserach within the individual attributes appraoch discusses class using losose gradational terms like upper, middle, and lower class, ther are some currents that attempt to specify an array of more qualtiatively distinguihsed categories
    
- **Class as oppurtunity hoarding**
    
- The problem of ''opportunity hoarding'' is closely assocaited with the work of Max Weber. The idea is that if a job is to confer on its occupants high income and special advantages it is important that the incumbents of those jobs have various means of excluding other people from access to the jobs
    
- Credentialing and licensing are particularly important mechanisms for oppurtunity hoarding , but many other insitituional devides habe been used; colour bars excluded racial minorities etc
    
- Perhaps most important exclusionary mechnaims that protexts the privelages and advnatages of people in certain hobs in a capitalist society is private property rights in the means of production
    
- Exclusionary mechnaimss that shape class structures within the opportunity hoarding appraoch do not oeprate only in the most privelaged parts of the class structure. Labour unions can also function in this way
    
- **Class as exploitation and domination**
    
- Class as exploitation and domination is the most controversial way of thinking about class
    
- ''domination' and ''exploitation'' are contentious words in sociology because they generally imply a moral judgement rather than being simply a nutral description
    
- ''domination'' refers to the ability to control the activities of others. ''exploitation'' refers to the acquisition of economic benifits from the labouring activity of those who are dominated
    
- In addition, the exploiting  group is able to control the labouring effort of another for its own advnatage
    
- Within the domination appraoch, the central class diviison is between the owners of the means of production and those that are hired to use those means of produtuon
    
- One way of combing the three appraoches is to see eahc of them as identifying a key process that shapes a different aspect of the class structure:
    
    - Explotitaion and domination mechanisms: the class division between captialsits and workers
        
    - The opportunity hoarding mechanisms identify the central mechanisms that differentiates middle class jobs from the broader working class by creating barriers that in one way or another restrict the supply of people for desirbale employment
        
    - Individual attributes and life conditions mechanisms identify a key set of processses through which idnividuals are sorted into different postiions in the class structre or marginalised form htose positions altogheter
        
        - Specifcy what it is in the lives of people that explains who has access to those desireable middle class jobs and who is exclusded from stable working class jobs
            
- Treating the underlying power relations that support a given structure of class locations as fixed parametres is deeply misleading and cotnributes to the incorrect view that the fate of indiviudals is simply a function of their attributes and individual circumstances
    
- **The american class structure**
    
- Econoic systems differ in how unfettered are the rights and powers that accompany private ownership of the means of production, and thus in the nature of the class division between captialists and workers
    
- An extermely rich capitalist class and corporate mangerial class with relatively weak constraints on their economic power
    
- Historicall large and stbale middle class
    
- A workign class that once was cahractereists by a large unionised segment but now lacks these protections
    
- A poor and precarious segment of the working class characterised by low wages and insecure employment
    
- A marginalised impoversighed sector of the population without the skills needed for jobs above the pvoerty level
    
- A pattern of interaciton of race and class in which the workign poor and the marginalised populatin are made up of racial minorities disproportionately
    
- **Towards an integrated class analysis**
    
- Adopting the integrated framework of class anlsis poses different kinds of challenges for analysts in teh marxist tradition
    
    - Recognising that what is most powerful within marxism is its theory of a specific array of causal mechanisms rathern than its aspiration to eb a comprehnsive paradigm of social sceince
        
- Stratification theroeties ahve ignored the problem of exploitation
    
- Weberians have always emphasied the improtance of pwoer within social structures and have no difficulty in distinguishing perosn and structured postions. Whilst exploitation has not figured centrally within Weberian analysis, there is no fundamental barrier within the logic of Weberian categories for inclduing it
