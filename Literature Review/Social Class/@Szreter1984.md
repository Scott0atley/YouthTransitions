### Abstract

```
Those empirical sociologists in Britain who are concerned with social classification have tended to avoid any detailed evaluation of the long-established and ubiquitous official system. Such a discussion is inhibited by our current state of ignorance regarding its historical origins. An investigation of the exact chronology of its development and elucidation of its author's intentions is, therefore, undertaken. This reveals a complex and protracted genesis, over the first three decades of this century. The final form of the official social classification was determined by the intellectual preoccupations of its progenitor, T.H.C. Stevenson, in seeking a comprehensive alternative explanation to that originally proposed by hereditarian 'sociologists ', to account for the phenomenon of fertility decline. Consequently, the now familiar five-graded hierarchy entails certain specific methodological assumptions and theoretical limitations, which, it is suggested, may constitute undesirable conceptual impedimenta for modern sociologists.

### Notes

“Consequently, the now familiar five-graded hierarchy entails certain specific methodological assumptions and theoretical limitations, which, it is suggested, may constitute undesirable conceptual impedimenta for modern sociologists” (Szreter, 1984, p. 522)

“In his 19 7 7 survey, Ivan Reid was able to conclude that 'the Registrar-General's social classes form the basis of all commonly used social classifications in Britain.” (Szreter, 1984, p. 523)

“In the 74th Annual Report of the Registrar-General, for the year of 1911, statistics were tabulated and published for the first time to show the extent of variation in infant mortality according to the parent's occupation” (Szreter, 1984, p. 530)

“This change of stance on Stevenson's part, between 1913 and 1927, over the rationale behind the creation of the special subsidiary classes is a significant indicator of a more fundamental change in his attitude towards the classification system which he had” (Szreter, 1984, p. 534)

“These assumptions, which carry important theoretical implications, are as follows: 1. That social inequality necessarily exists. 2. That there is a single continuous scale of social position or status, which can be conceptualized for convenience's sake, as a small number of ordered grades forming a hierarchy. 3. That this hierarchy is co-existent with the entire population of individuals comprising the nation, and exists throughout society in essentially the same form regardless of locality or community. 4. That the characteristic, 'status', can be both conceptualized and empirically measured as if it were a uni-dimensional property or attribute of individuals, possessed by all in varying degrees. 5. That occupation is the best reliable single such empirical indicator of this attribute of individuals.” (Szreter, 1984, p. 538)
