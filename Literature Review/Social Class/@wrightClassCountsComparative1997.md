### Notes

Gradational vs relational social class

- Ossowski (1963) argued that theories of class could be divided into those based on ''ordering relations'' (Gradational views) and those based on ''relations of dependence'' (relational views
    
    - ''the class division is conceived as a division into groups differentiated according to the degree in which they possess the characteristic which constitutes the criterion of division, as for instance income-level''[p.145]
        
    - ''social classes form a system according to their one-sided or mutual dependence, dependence being understood in both cases as a dependence based on causal relations'' [p.146]
        
- The hallmark of the gradational view is that classes are always characterised as being ''above'' or ''below'' other classes
    
- Problem of continuous versus discontinuous gradations within systems of stratification- the extent to which these divisions are purely conventional or real
    
    - Barber's (1957) words, ''divisional units within systems of social stratification''
        
- Two basic definitions of gradational conceptualisations of social class
    
    - One defines class gradations primarily in terms of income
        
        - (Mayer and Buckley 1970) ''in a class system, the social hierarchy is based primarily on differences in monetary wealth and income [p.15]''
            
            - Class structure identical to income distribution
                
    - Other primarily in terms of social status
        
        - Parsons (1970) classes should be defined as ''an aggregate of such units, individual and/or collective, that in their own estimation and those of others in the society occupy positions of approximately equal status [p.24]''
            
        - Williams (1960) also defines class in status terms: ''the distribution of privileges... Begins to take on full sociological meaning only when it is related to prestige rankings, social-interaction grouping, and beliefs and values held in common.''
            
- In contrast, relational concepts of social class, define class by their structured social relationship to other classes
    
    - Not simply defined relative to other classes but in a social relation to other classes
        
        - The criteria for class is based upon qualitative differences
            
    - Within a relational perspective, the working class is defined by its qualitative location within a social relation that simultaneously defines the capitalist class
        
    - Within Weberian theory, workers are understood as sellers of labour power, capitalists as buyers
        
- It could be argued that implicitly there is within a gradational views of inequality a notion of social relations
    
    - More social status than someone else requires recognition of that more and what that more entails
        
- Relational classes insist that the basic structures of inequality in a society are also structures of interests and thus the basis for collective social action. Social relations do not simply define classes, they also determine classes; classes as social forces are real consequences of social relations.
    
- Gradational class structures are static. They provide a basis to descriptively label. They cannot designate dynamic social forces which determine and transform that distribution
