### Notes

- The 70s and 80s were periods of massive social, economic, and political transformation
- school-to-work transition that up until the 1960s saw two thirds enter, 10 years years later saw only 1/3
- in place of jobs were training schemes offered by the governments Manpower Services Commission under the Youth Training Schemes (YTS)
- unskilled labour in manufacturing had all but disappeared
- Early Government intervention (Spurred by Thatcher years of less intervention) used the Youth Opportunities Programme (YOPs) to get kids off the streets
	- wasn't until the 1981 white paper, the New Training Initiative, heralded a new approach
	- Youth Training in the 1980s was terminated in 1988 as a national scheme and was handed over to the locally based Training and Enterprise Councils (TEC) 
	- in 1994 the modern apprenticeship (same as old but with only 2-years of training) was announced
	- the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) was set up in 1988 to rationalise the myriad of vocational qualifications
- These British labour market initiatives are defined through globalising pressures of technological change. For the worker, this meant greater uncertainty and risk (Beck 1986) 
- The 1970 generation faced structural factors on top of having to navigate the multitude of pathways on offer during the changing historical context
- Journalist Will Hutton refers to the '30/30/40' Society, whereby as much as 40% of the population are permeantly in a half-way house of casual jobs or continuing unemployment (Hutton 1995). 30/30/40 -> Getting on, getting by, getting nowhere. 
- on the continent in comparison to Britain, education participation rates changed more rapidly
	- From the total cohort of 600,000 16 year olds leaving school each year only 120,000 ever entered apprenticeships at their peak and only 20,000 of these were girls
	- the destruction of manufacturing industry hit boys more than girls, with the latter having higher job retention during the recessions (Ashton and Mayvire 1986)
	- the YOPs programme was less about employment opportunities and more about keeping kids off the streets (Bates et al 1984)
	- In 1981 the New Training Initiative heralded universal youth training for every school leaver, as a positive means of equipping them with new skills 
- The YTS introduced in 1983 and then extended to 2 years in 1986 offered by business or local community offered classroom based vocational training and work experiance
	- the 2 year YTS could be seen as a compressed German 'Dual-System' (Bynner and Roberts 1991)- famed as best vocational programme at the time
	- the major issue with the YTS is that it did not offer a full wage like a regular job, it offered an allowance
		- some called it 'Slave labour' (Bynner 1991) due to many end products being unemployment it was also called 'warehousing' (Banks et al 1992)
- Social security was withdrawn for young people in 1988, meaning unemployment was no longer a viable option 
- The 1970 cohort were right in the centre of all these changes. They could still opt for unemployment because when they turned 16 in 1986 social security benefits were still available. They could also opt YTS or stay in school. 
- 1970 was the last to experience the divided O-levels and CSE. After 16 they could (if teachers decided earlier) to do A-levels, or go to further educational colleges - These were fairly newly in place due to setting up of NCVQ in 1988
- the acquisition of human capital (Becker 1975) as embodied in educational qualifications remained predominantly with the middle class
- In place of life-long employment with a particular occupation, often with the same employer, the 1970 cohort faced much greater uncertainty 
	- how they reacted to labour market opportunities and constraints was affected to a great extent by their family situation
