PhD Project for Youth in Transition: Longitudinal Comparisons of Youth Transitions in the UK using Cohort and Synthetic Cohort Data

Using four cohort datasets: 1958, British Cohort Study 1970, British Household Panel Survey, and Understanding Society 2009, this project aims to bring new knowledge and understanding to Youth Transitions and wider Social Stratification literature in order to assess and analyse patterns of social inequality temporally in order to address such inequalities in the present period. 


**Project Plans:** 

By using existing large-scale social survey data resources to develop new youth data resources this work will seek to understand historical changes in youth transitions through comparative cohort analyses and through detailed empirical analyses documenting the patterns and trends in youth transitions during the closing decades of the twentieth century and the opening decades of the twenty-first century. In doing so, this project will provide a detailed empirical understanding of youth transitions that is theoretically informed by the conception of a life course perspective, and contribute to the wider understanding of the social processes that underpin social reproduction and the transmission of social inequalities. Finally this project will provide an evidence base that will inform the development of policy, especially in the fields of education and employment 

**Research Questions to keep in mind:**

	- What are the patterns of social inequality in youth transitions (e.g. Within cohorts)?
	- How have patterns and trends in youth transitions changed over time (i.e. Between cohorts)?
	- How have the social processes that underpin youth transitions changed over time?
	- How can youth transitions be more comprehensively understood within a life course perspective?

**A focus upon traditionally defined Youth Transitions:**

There are generally considered to be three different types of 'traditional transitions'. The first is termed 'school-to-work' which is defined as 'young people first leaving school at the minimum school leaving age and immediately, and with few difficulties, getting a job' (Coles 2006 p.91). The second is termed a 'housing transition' meaning that the young person leaves the family home and sets up a place of their own. Lastly a young person underwent a 'family transition' in which form a relationship, get engaged, then married, and upon marriage leaving home to live with their spouse. All of these transitions are interconnected. School-to-work leads to the ability to leave the family home which allows for the establishment of a family of your own.
