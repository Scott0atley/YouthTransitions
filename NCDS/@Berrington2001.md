### Abstract

```
Data from a national cohort study of men and women born in Britain in 1958 are used to examine factors influencing the outcome of cohabiting first partnerships. Conception is found to be a key factor promoting marriage for both men and women. Observed gender differences in the estimated impact of children on partnership stability are likely due to the incomplete reporting of past fertility among men. Social class and educational differentials in the likelihood of female cohabitors experiencing a conception, and their likelihood of subsequent marriage, suggest that the role of cohabitation varies according to socioeconomic background.
