### Abstract

```
This report investigates recent changes in social mobility by considering relationships between intermediate outcomes (degree attainment, test scores and non-cognitive abilities) and parental income for cohorts born between 1970 and 2000. There is no evidence that these relationships have changed in a consistent way over this period. This is in stark contrast with the strengthening relationship between intermediate outcomes and parental income that accompanied the previously well documented decline in social mobility that occurred for birth cohorts from 1958 and 1970. Our findings suggest that the decline in intergenerational mobility that occurred between these cohorts is not ongoing, but neither has there been any significant improvement.
