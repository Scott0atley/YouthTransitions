### Abstract

```
This paper uses National Child Development Study data for a large cohort of British individuals, to explore the influence of education, inheritance and other background characteristics on the propensity to become self-employed; and also on subsequent success, as measured by job and wealth creation. For the first time, we study the effects of our regressor variables on our success measures via disaggregation of our sample by gender – and, in this way, reveal striking differences between the determinants of male and female entrepreneurial performance.

### Notes

“high non-pecuniary motivation may improve a business’s financial performance.” (Burke et al., 2002, p. 268)

“males, non-pecuniary motivation has a positive impact on the value of the business – self-employed individuals who previously declared the importance to them of being their own boss tend, in following their predilection for independence, to also generate extra business value.” (Burke et al., 2002, p. 268)

“the desire to be one’s own boss has a negligible effect on the performance of female self-employed entrepreneurs.” (Burke et al., 2002, p. 268)
