### Abstract

```
Childhood experience has a central position in debates about the origins of social exclusion, the idea of which moves the emphasis in developmental problem processes away from disadvantage and individual failings to obstacles in the way of full participation in society, which it is the task of policy to remove.
```

### Notes
“he processes and the outcomes of social exclusion begin early in life and are manifested at all stages of life, producing a marginalised existence in adulthood, the routes to and outcomes of which may take a number of forms. These include: poor acquisition of basic skills; early leaving from education without qualifications; early labour market entry problems; including jobs without training, casual work and unemployment, teenage pregnancy; trouble with the police; drug and alcohol abuse; criminal convictions; poor physical and, especially, mental health; lack of engagement with the social and political functions of citizenship.” (Bynner, 1998, p. 1)
