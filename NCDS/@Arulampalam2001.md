### Abstract

```
This paper estimates the impact of work-related training on wage growth over the period 1981±91, using longitudinal data from the National Child Development Study, a cohort of young men aged 23 in 1981. A hurdle Negbin model is used to control for training endogeneity. We find that training incidence has a significant positive effect on wage growth. We also find that young men with a higher level of education are not only more likely to be trained, but are also more likely to experience substantially higher wage growth as a result.
