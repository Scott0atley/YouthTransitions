### Abstract

```
Saunders (1996, 1997) has argued, on the basis of analyses of the NCDS data-set, that present-day Britain is ‘to a large extent’ a meritocratic society: where individuals end up within the class structure is largely determined by their ability and effort. We have presented analyses (1999, 2001), using both the NCDS and the BCS70 data-sets, to show that Saunders’ argument is unsound, in part because of technical deciencies in his work but also because he fails to see the full implications of the results he reports. Saunders now attempts to rescue his position. However, we do not nd his latest contribution any more impressive than his earlier ones.
